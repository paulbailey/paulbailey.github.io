  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It's a murky pool to dive into, this P2P media sharing discussion. I remember Napster coming into being whilst I was at university, and being voraciously used by a lot of my friends (for some reason I was less keen, and I'm sure it wasn't a sense of propriety) including one who has gone on to carve out a successful career in the music industry. That's roughly a decade ago, and the issue is still not resolved. Sure, we can now legally and easily buy music online, and boy that took long enough, but the vast majority of music downloading online is unpaid for, and illegal. There are plenty of statistics flying about, most of which are (I believe) nonsense, or at least very exaggerated, although the really important ones (sales) are incontrovertibly heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>The record companies have acted as one might expect a shop to react upon discovering the concept of shoplifting. They're horrified, they want to do whatever they can to stop it, and are prepared to use heavy tactics to get their way. As large corporate entities, they have behaved exactly as we would have expected. And as aforementioned entities, they haven't got it right first time.</p>
<p>Enter the FAC, comprising a number of established, successful music acts, making a range of points about file sharing. Their point seems to roughly be "all publicity is good publicity", and cite increased concert ticket sales, merchandise and even album sales as side effects of having music downloaded. Equally they believe that cutting off a person's internet connection as a "punishment" is a draconian overreaction.</p>
<p>Some days after this, another well-known, successful artist has entered the fray. Famous (some might say infamous) for her forthright nature, Ms. Allen makes the point that it's all very well to take the FAC perspective if you're in Radiohead, since you're alright Jack. She also, quite rightly, asserts that the digital copying taking place today is not analogous to the home-taping of yesteryear. It was reading her blog on the subject that made me think.</p>
<p>They're all wrong. And they're all right. Allow me to explain; the record companies are right that if record sales/revenue decline, then there is not only less profit for them (their concern), there is also less budget for A&amp;R to discover new talent (our concern). The FAC are right that P2P file sharing provides the oxygen of publicity, and also undoubtedly drives secondary sales. Lily Allen is right, perfect digital copies are far, far removed from the radio taping and tape copies of other tapes/CDs. The quality is excellent. She's also right that new artists won't reap the benefits of P2P that established ones do. All very valid points.</p>
<p>Thing is, they're all short-sighted. Technology has consistently driven the recorded music industry, and it will continue to do so. Let's take a walk through history. Easy home taping was probably the first great threat to the music industry. They were worried that people making copies wouldn't spend money. Well, taping off the radio certainly wasn't a huge threat, since the DJs talking over intros and outros was always going to be annoying. Taping other tapes was more of a threat. Sure, there was a quality drop-off, but it wasn't massive. Indeed, although the copying process was not as easy as today's digital environment, it wasn't too much of a chore at the time. The music industry was dying. Oh, wait. Here are cheap(ish) CD players, with instant access to specific tracks, and better quality than tapes. They don't wear out (well, maybe) like tapes either. Music industry rejoice, we now prefer to buy CDs than copy with tape if we can. It's not all going to die after all.</p>
<p>Here's the CD burner now though. It's relatively easy to get an exact copy of a CD now. Still, the burners started out quite expensive, as did the discs, and there was always the chance that the odd disc wouldn't burn properly. Add in the requirement for a capable computer, still not ubiquitous at this point, and we'd still prefer to just buy the CD. Getting closer though.</p>
<p>Next, increased bandwidth and computing power. We can convert CDs into smaller, digital files that can be played on a computer, and that are just small enough to share online. They can still take a while to download though, and finding them isn't that easy. Between friends is probably the most common sharing mechanism. At this point, the music industry should have stepped in, and started selling cheap digital copies of music. The nascent P2P software would have had less take up with the man on the street, as the convenience factor of buying the 'original' would have won out. Missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Particularly as the iPod is now here. Yes there were other MP3 players before it, but with an easy to use interface and software, and great marketing, the mobile digital audio market took off. Getting music onto them required a (slowish) conversion of a CD though. Or an illegal download. Which was also free. Guess which one won out?</p>
<p>Bandwidth is still increasing, so the downloading option is now faster, and the P2P software is much more sophisticated. It's easier to find an illegal copy of something obscure than to actually buy it in the shop. Also, we can get a quality of digital download which (for most people) renders the additional quality of the CD an unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>We're coming up towards the present day now. Digital downloads are available, but they are DRM-laden, meaning that they're not easy to share, but equally not that easy to use on your multiple computers/mobile music players/cars/home sound systems. They also **still** don't have the breadth of music that CDs (and therefore illegal downloads) have. Some honest/lazy people use these download services, but most don't bother. Illegality has become the norm for acquiring music now. Because it was allowed to proliferate, most users don't even feel that they're doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>Streaming services exist, but they're not compatible across all computing platforms, require a monthly subscription, and aren't effective with mobile players (i.e. they're not iPod compatible, the *de facto* standard). Much breast beating in the music industry. Sales are now collapsing, and they realise that they've missed the boat. Unfortunately, their response is to try to sink the boat, rather than charter another one to catch up.</p>
<p>And we're at the present at last. CDs are regularly leaked online, in high quality versions, before the CDs are commercially available. The illegal channel has won, on speed, convenience and time to market. Spotify arrives, working on all (with some provisos) platforms, and offers free streaming with advertising inserted, essentially mirroring the commercial radio model. Doubts are expressed that this can generate enough revenue to sustain their business model, and therefore the music industry.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to stop talking about what has happened, and get onto what I think will happen. The key is Spotify's mobile service. They've released a streaming version, that requires a subscription, not advertising. It has good (but not yet good enough) coverage of music and works well. This is where I think technology, as it has (and could have) in the past, will help. People will take the path of least resistance in most matters, and music consumption is one such area. Once streaming on a phone/computer is easier than downloading, and quicker, they'll start to be interested. If the subscription rate is equitable, they'd rather pay it to avoid the hassle of illegal downloading. Technology has to catch up, and by this I mean both the phone/player device and sufficient mobile bandwidth for there to be no irritating drop-outs. We're not there yet, but it won't be long. Look at the pace of progress.</p>
<p>All the industry needs to do is stop being defensive, and put itself at the cutting edge of the new developments. They dropped the ball 10 years ago, when they were woefully late with legal downloads. We can only hope, for the sake of us hearing good music, that they get with the programme this time.</p>
<p>###ADDENDUM</p>
<p>I'm aware that some people feel that the "democratising nature of the web" will just cut the record companies out of the loop, and put music fans directly in contact with the artists. I've got news for you; the web doesn't democratise shit. Bandwidth costs, servers cost, musical equipment/instruments cost, rent costs, food costs. We have to pay for our music. It's all about how. The independent model will introduce too many hassles for the consumer for it to ever take off.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong. I've been wrong before.</p>
