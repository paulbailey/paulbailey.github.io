<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207180113/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3633258.stm">Bill Clinton is recovering after his successful heart bypass operation</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to express my best wishes to him, and his family, during his recovery period. Regardless of his philandering, and his occasional vanity, he was an excellent president, and a credit to his nation. An extremely intelligent and well-informed man, he understood the global nature of political problems in the 20th century, and contributed immeasurably to a development of closer relations between the US and other nations (there is often a larger gap than people in the USA sometimes imagine). He was easily the most popular president outside US borders for many years.</p>
<p>As the youngest ever ex-president, he is a charismatic and <em>articulate</em> public speaker, funny and relevant at the same time. Anyone who saw his speeches at both the Labour and Democratic party conference would see the effect he could have on a crowd.</p>
<p>All the best, Bill!</p>
