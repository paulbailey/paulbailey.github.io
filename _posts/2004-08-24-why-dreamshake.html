<p>Well, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050221183955/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=may_peter&amp;id=1444406">this link</a> describes the basketball player that inspired me to use the expression.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050221183955/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/980316/5bestmoves1.html">Phil Taylor's article on CNNSI.com</a> describes the move itself.  I'll just give you an extract:</p>
<p><em>The beauty of Hakeem Olajuwon's move is its countless variations. Like snowflakes, no two Dream Shakes are exactly alike. "He steps in, gives you three or four fakes, goes up and under or goes to the fadeaway," says Heard. "You don't know what shot he's going to take because he has them all combined." </em></p>
<p><em>It seems odd that the most graceful, fluid move in the league would belong to a center. When Olajuwon was learning the game, he studied not just centers but also forwards and guards, and it's obvious he has incorporated into his game moves that typically belong to smaller players. He goes through a series of spins, fake spins, pump fakes and up-and-under moves until the defender finally bites. Then Olajuwon can finish off the move with a fadeaway jumper, a short jump hook or a dunk. </em></p>
