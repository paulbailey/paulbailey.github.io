<p>Just heard this story breaking where I usually hear new stuff (don't make me use the T word). Edgar Wright, director of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz amongst other things, wrote a lovely blog post about working with the late Edward Woodward several days ago. I read it at the time, and thought it was a moving piece. <a href="http://www.edgarwrighthere.com/2009/11/edward-woodward-1930-2009/">Edgar's thoughts on the departed Mr Woodward</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/entertainment_news/article6919166.ece">It seems that The Times thought so too</a>. Which was nice. Except they didn't ask Edgar if they could use his piece, and to add insult to injury, have sub-edited it in a <a href="http://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/5860982798">manner that he feels misrepresents him</a>. Oh dear.</p>
<p>And all this from an organisation that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/6533512/Rupert-Murdoch-could-sue-BBC-and-block-Google.html">plans to sue Google and the BBC for stealing their content</a>.</p>
<p>Well, it's a new online business model at least. Nick the content, then charge for it.</p>
<p><em>EDIT - I've just seen <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/nov/19/edgar-wright-the-times">via The Guardian website</a> that it was in the print version of the newspaper. Even worse.</em></p>
