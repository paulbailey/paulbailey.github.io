<p>This probably won't be a popular post, but the tax affairs of celebrities (and non-celebrities) don't seem to be leaving the news agenda any time soon, so I wanted to put my thoughts down in writing.</p>
<p>There's a chance that this will be seen as a defence of Jimmy Carr, or Gary Barlow, or even, heaven forbid, Sir Phillip Green. It certainly isn't intended as such, and personally I feel that a Keynesian approach to the recession is by far the most sensible. Given that, I do feel that a higher tax burden needs be borne by the more well off.</p>
<p>What I don't think, however, is that morality should form part of how tax is calculated. Here's why.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back, you might remember a fair-sized kerfuffle about certain individuals remuneration in the public sector. Without going into too much detail, certain people with fixed-term contracts, often in senior positions, were being paid through a limited company, rather than as employees. By being paid in this manner, they could take a large proportion of their income as a dividend, attracting a lower rate of tax, rather than as salary. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16854187">Ed Lester, the head of the Student Loans Company</a>, was one such individual.</p>
<p>This was roundly condemned in the media, and condemned as tax avoidance. There was one point not mentioned in the coverage though. <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ir35/">IR35</a>, introduced in 2000, seeks to define "disguised employment", and means that someone working through a limited company for the purpose of reducing their tax burden, is liable to be taxed as if an employee.</p>
<p>Simply put, if an individual is working in this manner, they're liable to pay the greater amount of tax. It might be argued that this regulation is not well enforced, but then we should look at better funding for HMRC.</p>
<p>Following on from the Jimmy Carr revelations, newspapers have reported that JK Rowling "pays all her taxes". I'm sure she does, and she has</p>
