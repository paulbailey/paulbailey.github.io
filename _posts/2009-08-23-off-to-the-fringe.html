<p>So, it's 8:45, and I'm in the air over Birmingham (according to the reassuring voice of the captain). I've been up for 3 1/2 hours now, and despite drinking until midnight, and going to bed at 1am, I feel surprisingly good.</p>
<p>I've just realised in my haste that I booked a ticket for Chris Cox's show on Friday, rather than today. Hope it isn't sold out, as I'm really keen to see it.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, the cricket is poised to be interesting today, so I may be distracted during the afternoon, we'll have to see. As the last thing I'm booked to see today is due to finish at 2:30am, I'll have been awake for roughly 22 hours on 4 hours of drunken sleep. I'm actually interested to see how grumpy I am tomorrow!</p>
<p>On a more whimsical note, and this may be an indication of my tiredness already, I'm attending the Edinburgh fringe with possibly the longest fringe I've had in a decade. God, that is awful. I'm definitely tired. May need to find a park bench to sleep on this morning before I can check into my hotel!</p>
