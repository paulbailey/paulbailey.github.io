<p>Check out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040208224339/http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>. If you don't know, a wiki is a website that allows all visitors to it to edit it's content. In that regard, it's very much like Tim Berners-Lee's original vision for the worldwide web, a collaborative effort, rather than a content provider just pushing data to consumers.</p>
<p>Anyway, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and quite and extensive one at that, with the difference being that anyone can edit and add entries. I've just put in some more information about Werrington, for example.</p>
<p>I like the idea of sharing information like this, and it's pleasing to see that it isn't actively being defaced.</p>
