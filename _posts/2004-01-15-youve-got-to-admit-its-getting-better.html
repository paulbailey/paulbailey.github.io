<p>Well, 2004 is here, and guess what, it's not so different than last year so far. I went down to Clapham for NYE, and had quite a lot to drink (oh, OK, lots to drink) in a bar called B@1. It was good fun, although I might have felt better the next day if I hadn't decided to emulate Jeff Bridges in "The Big Lebowski", and drink lots of White Russians!</p>
<p>I've got this weekend off, and then I'm out and about all over the country the following three weekends, so I'm going to try to get the work finished on my new website. It's coming along fairly well, and hopefully there'll be more than this blog at dreamshake.net very soon. Not that it'll be hugely interesting, but at least there will be more to read than just my occasional ramblings.</p>
<p>Still waiting to hear from Mr. Collins about his New Year's experience.  Should be interesting!</p>
