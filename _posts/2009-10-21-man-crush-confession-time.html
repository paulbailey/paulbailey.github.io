<p>I think Peter Serafinowicz is very funny. I don't know why the BBC didn't commission another series of his sketch show. Fools. They'll regret that come Judgement Day. Which for the BBC is likely to be the day after the next election. Little bit of politics there.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, he's a great impressionist. I'm a huge Beatles fan, and he does all four of them brilliantly. This is his Fab Four parody on the <a href="http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/" target="_blank">excellent Funny or Die UK website</a>:</p>

<p>If you're a Twit (or a "twat" as David Cameron likes to call us) get following him, he's <a href="http://twitter.com/serafinowicz" target="_blank">@serafinowicz</a>. His brother (who produced The Peter Serafinowicz Show) is apparently "Head of Content" at Funny or Die UK. He's <a href="http://twitter.com/flidby" target="_blank">@flidby</a> on Twitter.</p>
