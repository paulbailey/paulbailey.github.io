<p>Saturday night in, alone and ill...  hence the particular lyrical title.</p>
<p>Had lunch with Helen today, which was great. Sometimes you look back, and wonder... but then sometimes I wonder how life has conspired to ensure that I'm not (currently) rich and famous!</p>
<p>Anyway, real reason for my post:  If you're obsessed with music, a bit like me, this site is <strong>very</strong> cool!  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040209112420/http://www.coversproject.com/">Coversproject.com</a> lists all songs that an artist or band has covered, and all of their songs that someone else has covered. Very entertaining, and is certainly whiling a few hours away this evening.</p>
