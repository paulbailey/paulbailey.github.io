<p>Here's a little story: At the time of last year's London mayoral election, I was living in a shared house. Whether accidentally or deliberately, someone living in the flat removed me (illegally I might add) from the electoral register. I didn't discover this until it was too late to get re-registered in time to put a cross in a box.</p>
<p>Wanting to vote, but not being able to, was one of the worst feelings I can remember. Particularly as the candidate I didn't support won. It was this that made me realise how lucky I am to be able to influence the government of my country through the ballot box. We really are very privileged to have the freedom to express ourselves in this manner, regardless of colour, creed, education, sex and all other discriminatory factors.</p>
<p>Feel good about yourself today. Express your opinion. Vote.</p>
