<p>I've been busy.</p>
<h3>Monday</h3>
<p>Went to see As It Occurs To Me. It was the fourth episode and a lot of fun. I've been to every one so far, and I'm planning to go to the lot of them. I think it's a good idea (a scripted topical radio-style show, but released via podcast rather than broadcast) and if people don't support it financially by going along to the recordings, it'll stop happening. <a href="http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/lqt/show/S1251303475/Richard+Herring%3A+As+It+Occurs+To+Me" target="_blank">Get your tickets here</a>, it's on every Monday at the Leicester Square Theatre in that London. And I say that despite the (hopefully tongue-in-cheek) mocking Richard Herring reserves for the people who go every week!</p>
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<p>It was a benefit gig tonight, for Bletchley Park, called <a href="http://www.boffoonery.com/index.html" target="_blank">Boffoonery</a>. Great line up, with some stand up, some sketches, a demonstration of an actual Enigma machine by Simon Singh, and a brilliant panel quiz show, featuring Robin Ince, Johnny Ball, and the aforementioned Herring. Oh, and the question master was Robert Llewellyn (Kryten from Red Dwarf). Cracking entertainment in a good cause.</p>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p>This was a later one, going to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Gonzales</a> perform his Piano Talk Show at the Pigalle Club. It was an eclectic evening, bit of virtuoso piano playing, some random banter, some rapping, a guitar getting smashed up and audience participation. Oh, and Jarvis Cocker got up for a bit of a chat, and a couple of songs. Good stuff.</p>
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<p>This was my night off, until I heard that <a href="http://www.helenarney.com/" target="_blank">Helen Arney</a> was performing her Edinburgh show, 8 + ½ songs about love (and other myths),  in Camden. I'd seen her do a turn at the Book Club I went to at the Fringe this year, and was gutted I couldn't get to see her show at the time. I was really pleased I went as it was very funny, and very sweet at the same time. If you get the chance, go to see her. It's ace.</p>
<h3>Friday (tonight)</h3>
<p>Off to Kings Place to see Charlie Brooker in conversation with Marina Hyde to promote the launch of his book. Hopefully it's good, and I'm not out too late. And then I get the weekend to recover. Or do I?</p>
