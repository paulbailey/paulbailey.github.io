<p>I'm off to see a lot of cool live stuff on the Isle of Wight, at Bestival. It's not huge like Glasto, but it has an [amazing lineup](http://www.bestival.net/html/artists/2009lineup), and the weather's set fair too.</p>
<p>I've had a pretty average last couple of weeks, and this is just the tonic I need. Now, if only I knew someone with a helicopter, so I didn't have to get up in five hours...</p>
<p>See you all on the flipside!</p>
