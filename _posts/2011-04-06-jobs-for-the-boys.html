<p>Just reading Nick Clegg's article in the Standard. Earlier in the day, somewhat unfairly, I might have called him a hypocrite, because he had benefited from an internship organised by his father's friend.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something about his article. He claims:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>"who you know is becoming increasingly more important than what you know"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not a banker (whatever that means exactly), but I do work in the City, and I have done on and off for the last 6 years. I would say it is generally accepted that, if anything, the old boy's network is <em>less</em> influential these days.</p>
<p>The globalisation of the finance industry means working practices have changed noticeably over the last few decades. Incidentally, the Americans are usually blamed for this shift, but that's probably unfair too.</p>
<p>Clegg very probably has a point, but to suggest the Square Mile is less of a meritocracy now than in, say, the 1960s? I find that very hard to believe.</p>
