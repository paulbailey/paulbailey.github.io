<p>Bugger me, it's hot! Even the latest thunder storm doesn't seem to have cleared the air. I definitely reckon I'd be better off in Sydney, with Abs and Neil.</p>
<p>New job came through today too.  I'm <strong>very</strong> pleased.  BBQ at the weekend will be the perfect opportunity to celebrate...</p>
