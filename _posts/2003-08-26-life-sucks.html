<p>Mostly, I haven't discussed anything personal, or less trivial on my blog. In fact, on most occasions, I've actively avoided it. I'm not a person who is comfortable discussing personal or emotional matters at the best of times, let alone doing it on a website. The events of the last few days have left me feeling a bit empty and confused, so I feel the need to offload a little bit.</p>
<p>Some background first. Two weeks ago, I was set up with the friend of a friend. Normally, I wouldn't go near that kind of situation with a barge pole, but the person doing the introducing is someone who I trust, and I figured that I had very little to lose. Anyway, having met this person, I thought it had been a very good idea! She was really cool, we seemed to get on well, I thought she was attractive, so I was keen to meet her again.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this weekend, and we're both at a barbeque. Most of the people there are her friends, which made me feel a little bit nervous, but she was great, and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Then, out of the blue, an argument that I had had with our mutual friend came up in conversation, and things took a downward turn.</p>
<p>Now, I'm the first to admit that I wasn't keen to explain the circumstances of the falling out to her. It didn't make me look great, and obviously I didn't want to put her off. For the purposes of talking (writing?) through this an explanation is necessary. About a month ago, both me and the perosn that I fell out with were at a barbeque (maybe I should stay away from barbeques!), and she heard me describe one of her (other) friends as fat.</p>
<p>Now, I'm nobody's fool, and I should have realised that word is not an adjective to use in polite company, but I did use it. I had been drinking for 12 hours, so my recollection isn't perfect, but I'm sure that I didn't use it in the pejorative sense. In actual fact, I thought that the person I had used it to describe was quite attractive. I think we really argued because my friend had reacted by shouting at me, and I don't take to that sort of thing too kindly. I'm perfectly prepared to admit that I was insensitive and stupid to describe someone's friend in that way. I said as much by the end of the argument, and thought very little about it. If anything, I thought that the disagreement was quite amusing, in the way that it had descended into a shouting match! We were too similar really, and rational discussion went out of the window.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to last weekend. Eventually, the girl who I had been getting on so well with (let's call her Louise) kept asking my partner-in-arguing (let's call her Hannah) what the argument was about. Understandably, Hannah told Louise all about it. I wasn't aware that any of this had happened at the time. So, half an hour later, when I'm wondering where Louise has gone, I find her upstairs, and discover that Hannah has explained what happened. Louise was really upset about it all, to the point of crying, and, after not too long, I left, going home feeling pretty crushed if I'm honest. A couple of hours before things had been going so well, and now this.</p>
<p>The next day I woke up, still feeling pretty shit (it's not nice to know that you've made someone cry), and sent Louise a text message, attempting to apologise, and telling her that I'd really like to see her again. She said that she didn't want to, which is fair enough, and I went into full self-pity mode. It was only when I tried to explain to a friend of mine why I had such a bad weekend that I really started to think about events.</p>
<p>I like to try to put myself in the other person's shoes when I'm looking at things. How would I have reacted in her position? And that was when it struck me. I wouldn't have reacted like that. I would have been angry that someone had felt able to insult my friend (which is what I did, albeit unintentionally), and I'm as defensive of my friends as anyone. Would I have elected not to see them again, not to even ask them about what they had said? No. Would I have judged them by one drunken comment? No. And herein lies my dilemma.</p>
<p>In a way, now I feel angry and confused. I can understand why Louise is upset, but I can't understand her reaction (not entirely anyway). Normally I'd just be angry, but I like Louise a lot, more than anyone I have met in a long time. So I'm the real loser here, and I feel gutted.</p>
<p>To top it all off, it seems as though Hannah isn't speaking to me either, or at the very least, isn't over-keen to say anything. Which I really don't understand. Anyone who knows me should know I can be very harsh and tactless at times, but I'm not nasty or vindictive, and appearance means very little to me. But I feel like the bad guy. If I had gone to bed earlier a month ago, I'd probably have the chance to see Louise again. As it stands, that's not happening, and one of my friends isn't speaking to me either, and it feels as though there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, and to close this entry, see the title;  Life Sucks!</p>
