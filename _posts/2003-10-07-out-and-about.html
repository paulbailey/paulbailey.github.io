<p>I'm out and about on my travels this week... heading down to London for a couple of days for a dull training course (and taking the opportunity to have some beers whilst I'm down there), then it's off to Vienna for a long weekend.</p>
<p>Really looking for to that, actually, it'll be good to leave this sceptred isle again, since it's been a while. Not to mention I'm visiting Nicky, who I have hardly seen since I left university. Should be a good laugh!</p>
