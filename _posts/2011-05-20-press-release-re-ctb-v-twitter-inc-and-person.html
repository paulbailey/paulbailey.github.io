<p>This release seems to be from a law firm touting themselves as availablefor comment, but it appears to confirm the details of the new case being brought.</p>
<blockquote><p>Footballer CTB is suing Twitter</p>
<p>Nick Armstrong, Partner, Sports &amp; Media Group at Charles Russell LLPcomments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twitter Inc. and some of its users are being sued in the High Courtin London by the individual who obtained an injunction against The Sunand Imogen Thomas concerning allegations about his private life.  In theinjunction action (see below), and in the new Twitter action, he isreferred to as "CTB&rdquo;.  The full case title of the new action is CTB v.Twitter Inc. and Persons Unknown.  It is case no. HQ11X01814.</p>
<p>The action was commenced on 18 May. The &ldquo;persons unknown&rdquo; aredescribed as those &ldquo;responsible for the publication of information onthe Twitter accounts&rdquo; but the latter are listed in confidentialappendices.  It relates to the widely-reported posting on May 8 of aseries of &ldquo;tweets&rdquo; purporting to name a number of celebrities who hadobtained so-called super-injunctions, and describe the activitiescovered by the injunctions.</p>
<p>It marks the first concerted attempt to deal legally with way in whichsocial media have of late been used an a vehicle for gossip and supposed&lsquo;information&rsquo; in an apparent attempt to undermine or evade the authorityof the High Court.</p>
<p>The news comes in the week that sees judicial attempts to inject someclarity into a public debate which in the media at least has featuredwild and inaccurate comment about the perceived threat posed by &ldquo;superinjunctions&rdquo;. For one thing, the injunctions that have caused the debatearen&rsquo;t super injunctions at all &ndash; the term was hijacked in the media torefer misleadingly to the injunctions obtained by celebrities whoseidentities were anonymised to enable the injunction to be effective. TheNeuberger Report (of the Committee on Super-Injunctions) was publishedon 20 May.  It points out that in fact the Super-Injunction is an orderwhich prohibits (i) publishing confidential or private information AND(ii) publicising or informing others of the existence of the order andthe proceedings. Super-injunctions are reserved for exceptional casesand are only granted for very short periods, and only where this levelof secrecy is necessary to ensure that the whole point of the order isnot destroyed. Since January 2010, only two such super-injunctions havebeen granted, one which was set aside on appeal and the second which wasin force for seven days.</p>
<p>That is not the case with the celebrity injunctions, which are termed&ldquo;Anonymised Injunctions&rdquo; i.e. the names of either or both of the partiesto the proceedings are not stated.</p>
<p>In fact the principles of open justice are respected by AnonymisedInjunctions because, since the relevant parties are anonymised, a fulljudgment can be issued in which the judge sets out his reasons forapplying the balancing factors imposed by the Human Rights Act (right tofreedom of expression v right to respect for pricate and family life) inmaking the order.  This strikes the balance between open justice, andappropriate protection of privacy where the judge has found that to berequired on the basis of the evidence put before him.</p>
<p>This happened this week when Eady J published his judgment in the CTB&lsquo;Anonymised Injunction&rsquo; case itself.  It should be read<a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2011/ctb-v-ng%0An-limited-judgment-16052011">http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2011/ctb-v-ngn-limited-judgment-16052011</a> by anyone thinking of commenting about theissue of Anonymised Injunctions, as it puts in context much ill-informedcomment which has obscured many of the real issues involved in thedeveloping (and still very young) law of privacy enacted by Parliamentin 1998 and applied by the judiciary."</p>
<p>I would like to offer a spokesperson from Charles Russell LLP for anycoverage you may be scheduling in regard to this announcement.</p>
