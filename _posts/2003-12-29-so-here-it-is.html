<p>A belated Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year to everyone who occasionally reads this blog (which, surprisingly, is up to double figures by all accounts). I'm back at work today, which is a bugger, but there's not a huge amount happening today.</p>
<p>Saw a few people I haven't seen for ages at a school reunion on the 27th, which was cool. I'll do another entry this afternoon, detailing a bit more about the evening...</p>
