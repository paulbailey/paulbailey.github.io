<p>When Diana Spencer died, I was bemused. I wouldn't wish anyone dead, but I couldn't understand all of the kerfuffle that went along with the event.</p>
<p>It appears that Michael Jackson might be dead. Again, I don't really get it. I was never his biggest fan, but the word "genius" is being bandied around again. That word is over-used, and it's not appropriate here (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Still, it's quite interesting watching the news unfold on social media, the online press, and TV and radio. There's probably some more to be said about the coverage, after this evening.</p>
