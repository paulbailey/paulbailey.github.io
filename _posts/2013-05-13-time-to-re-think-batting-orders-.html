<p>I've been meaning to write up my thoughts about this for a while, and <a title="Cricinfo: Saving the best for the last" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/current/story/635610.html">this article on Cricinfo</a> reminded me to quickly note down my thoughts.</p>
<p>Simply put; batting orders are an anachronistic carry-over from "unlimited over" cricket, and don't make sense in modern 20/40/50 over cricket. The advantage a batsman gets psychologically from knowing when they will be going out to bat is lost when they might be batting at 4-1 or 104-1. It takes a very special player to be able to bat equally effectively in both situations.</p>
<p>Currently teams tinker with their batting lineup, and sometimes send lower-order players out when big hitting is required, but this (it appears to me) is done in a very ad hoc fashion. My proposal is that a batsman's position be defined by overs remaining.</p>
