<p>I'm going to make a concerted effort to try to make more, and better entries here. After my extended diatribe about last weekend (I'm still a bit confused about everything that happened?!), back to happier things. Hopefully Houston is coming together for a holiday in December, off to London for the weekend, and the Deeping basketball season is almost upon us again.</p>
<p>Cool!</p>
