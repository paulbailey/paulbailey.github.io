<p>Just a swift note about last night's entertainment. I was at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Club">legendary</a> <a href="http://www.the100club.co.uk/">100 Club</a>, to see <a href="http://www.karaokecircus.com/">Karaoke Circus</a>. It was absolutely bloody marvellous. I'd do a review, but I have a memory like a sieve, and plenty of people have posted about it already. Like:</p>

<li><a href="http://offensive-mango.livejournal.com/571865.html" target="_blank">The winner of the open mic spot</a></li>
<li><a href="http://martylog.livejournal.com/295356.html" target="_blank">One of the hard-working musical geniuses behind the evening</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/observationsandmachinations/sets/72157621151970854/show/" target="_blank">I took some photos.</a> They're playing <a href="http://www.latitudefestival.co.uk/lineup/artist.aspx?AID=e308ce66-d855-42fc-9bae-4819e95820ae&amp;artist=Ward%20&amp;%20White's%20Karaoke%20Circus" target="_blank">Latitude festival</a>, and at Edinburgh too. Get there. Seriously.</p>
