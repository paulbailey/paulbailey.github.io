<p>Sadly, the Wayback archive, which has chunks of my site back to July 2002, is picking up the robots.txt of the new owner. This means that, although they have my old content archived, I can't see it. Bearing in mind how cringe-making reading my old entries has been, maybe that's no bad thing!</p>
