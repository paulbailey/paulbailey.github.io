<p>Any recommendations for where we can go in Boston?  New York already has quite a long list of things to see and do in a few days…</p>
<p>I love last minute holidays.  Maybe this one isn’t quite last minute, but the details are coming together less than a month before I go.</p>
<p>(Before anyone tries to be funny, no not Boston, Lincolnshire!)</p>
