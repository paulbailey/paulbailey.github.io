<p>Just a short one. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport release their 'Digital Britain' report this afternoon. There is some talk of the licence fee being shared with commercial broadcasters, and a number of politicians from the right are constantly sniping at the BBC. I presume that this is at least something to do with BBC funding being almost the exact opposite of a free market.</p>
<p>Let me just say that the dross churned out by ITV, and the shows it is cancelling through lack of funding, demonstrate how the free market doesn't provide good television. The licence fee is one of the purchases I'm happiest to make every year. Please don't take money away from one of the things this country does very, very well.</p>
