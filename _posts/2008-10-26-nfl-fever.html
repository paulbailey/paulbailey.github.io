<p>Flying back from Liverpool as I type (courtesy of Wordpress’s excellent free iPhone app). What a strange couple of nights out that was! I don’t think I’m cut out for the kind of evenings that we went on. More of that (maybe) later.</p>
<p>What I am now very excited about is seeing a live NFL game, and maybe even taking a couple of photos, if I can get back to the flat in time to pick up my camera! I’ll be pulling for the Chargers, since I’m a big fan of Ladanian Tomlinson. Shame he’s not 100% fit. I’d love to see him take a few snaps in the single wing offense, now football has come full-circle, courtesy of the ‘Fins.</p>
