<p>So, as things stand, the “head count” is at two and a half.  Both Russell Brand and Lesley Douglas, the controller of Radio 2, have resigned.  Jonathan Ross has been suspended for 12 weeks.  All for a mildly unfunny section of a very popular radio programme than actually precipitated two (yes, two, count them) complaints, both for bad language.  Never mind that this was a pre-recorded session, and the final responsibility for transmission lay elsewhere.  Never mind that the audience for the show, one of the more popular on Radio 2, both live and online, barely complained.</p>
<p>Another agenda was underpinning this episode.  The tabloids (that means you too, Mail on Sunday) whipped up a furore, and precipitated a volume of complaints that meant the BBC had to react.  In the process, opportunities were presented to bash the organisation, and its decline in standards.  The salary of Ross loomed large in most complainers’ comments, as well as their personal dislike of Brand’s style. I’ll wager that very few people upset by this, who are so willing to vent their spleens, have even heard that section of the programme in context.  Nor have they taken into account the very dignified and reasonable comments made by Andrew Sachs himself, both prior and subsequent to personal apologies being given.</p>
<p>It’s highly likely to me that Sachs would more likely be embarrassed by his granddaughter’s appearance on various websites, in a state of undress, covered in fake blood. Or possibly by her exclusive “stories” in the Sun, orchestrated, no doubt, by Max Clifford, her newly-appointed publicist. One might speculate, given that her concern for her grandfather is foremost in her mind, a dignified silence, or simple statement, would suffice? From where I’m sitting, money and self-promotion have become the priority.</p>
<p>This tabloid baying for blood is becoming all too common, and the nation (or at least a certain part of it) seems happy to go along.  Don’t think I haven’t noticed politicians from both sides of the House attempting to make political capital from the affair too. Very unedifying.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what makes me feel that this is all a huge overreaction, and a case of the media monster feeding itself?  Of all the “celebrity” talking heads who have opined, who is the most fervent in supporting their sacking?</p>
<p>Louis Walsh.</p>
<p>QED</p>
<p><em>[Full disclosure: I subscribed to the defunct Russell Brand podcast, and found it quite amusing. Jonathan Ross, the less said the better. Although he is funnier on the radio than the TV. Not hard.]</em></p>
