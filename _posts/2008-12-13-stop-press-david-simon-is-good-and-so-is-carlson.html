<p>I find it sadly gratifying when someone I admire agrees with my opinion.  I’ve just seen [Mike Carlson’s review of Homicide](http://irresistibletargets.blogspot.com/2008/11/wire-to-wire-david-simons-homicide.html), and (unsurprisingly) he is a great fan of the book. On one of his multiple blogs (that I’ve also just seen) Mike says that he was glad of the opportunity to praise the book, which he read years ago. Who would have thought that the pundit on US sports, on a not terribly popular terrestrial channel, would be so amusing, engaging, and erudite, across a broad range of topics. We jump to conclusions at our peril.</p>
