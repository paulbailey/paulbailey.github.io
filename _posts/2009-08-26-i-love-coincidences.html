<p>When they're funny, it's even better.</p>
<p>It started with a bit of Facebook banter. My friend had set his status as:</p>
<p>'Dan has just bought a Dire Straits album. Does that make me a bad person?'</p>
<p>Me: 'It's a cheaper early mid-life crisis than a motorbike.'<br />
Dan: 'Alright, alright! It was only for research purposes anyway...'<br />
Me: 'Ah, the Pete Townshend defence.'<br />
Me: '(is that joke in bad taste? Can't tell these days)'<br />
Dan: 'Thanks for using my status page as a space to experiment with your sick brand of humour Paul ;)'</p>
<p>What really made me laugh was Spotify throwing up <em>The Kids Are Alright</em> by <strong>The Who</strong> literally 10 seconds after this exchange.</p>
<p>Simple things...</p>
