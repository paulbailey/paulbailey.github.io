<p>Well, this is the first opportunity I've really had to make an entry about my holiday so far. First off, I flew into Palm Beach on the 10th, met Mark and we drove approximately an hour up the coast to a small town called Vero Beach, where he's been staying whilst he's been doing his flight training. Vero is quiet, and not too much happens there, but we had a few nights out that were pretty good.</p>
<p>On Monday, we came down to Miami for a few days, and we're staying in Miami Beach, in a hotel on Collins Avenue. Ocean Drive is about a 10-15 minute walk away, and whilst the weather has been overcast some of the time, it's always been warm. So far, I've been eyed up by the best-looking transvestite I've ever seen (when we left the club, she was snogging a bloke that I'm 100% certain didn't know she was male). I've also been accused of being gay by an Australian (now that hurt!), and she just wouldn't accept that I was straight. Sadly, she wandered off before I got the chance to show her first-hand that I was indeed heterosexual.</p>
<p>We met a very fit barmaid for breakfast (who was lovely too. Unlike a lot of US women) and last night went to a bar that I swear was straight out of Coyote Ugly (if you haven't seen the film, insanely attractive barstaff, scantily clad, serving drinks and dancing on the bar). Again, me and Mark were asked if we were a couple, but at least this time I got the chance to demonstrate that I wasn't to the girl in question! Oh, one other thing, this bar wasn't letting men in, only women, because "there are already too many guys in here", so we talked a couple of local girls into accompanying us in, and bought them some drinks. I like a bar that stops letting men in (as long as I'm already inside!).</p>
<p>Almost forgot, went to a Heat game last night, and saw Miami beat Atlanta quite comfortably. Great arena, but disappointingly there were probably only about 6,000 people. Dwyane Wade will be a great player, if last night is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of bad weather on Mark's flight test, this is our last full day in Miami, as he has to go back to do his practical test in Vero on Friday. Still, it'll be a way to save money for a couple of days, before heading down to West Palm Beach on Saturday to hit the tiles, and catch our flight home :( on Sunday.</p>
<p>Well, that's about it for the time being, maybe I'll post again before I get home, but it's unlikely. Finding internet access isn't at the top of my list of things to do!</p>
