<p>So, I was exchanging some bantersome online messages with a friend of mine, and she (indirectly) called me middle class. Obviously, this is the first thing I thought of:</p>
<p>I have to admit to being a bit upset to be described that way. Maybe "upset" is the wrong word. I was interested that I paused for thought when that phrase was used. Let's be honest, I work in IT, live in a nice part of London, I have a <em>blog</em> for heaven's sake! Of course I'm middle class. Am I?</p>
<p>Now, there have been earnest TV documentaries on this subject (and that one with John Prescott, which just seemed to be intentionally (from a production perspective)/unintentionally (from Two Jags perspective) hilarious. It would be a bit disingenuous of me to proclaim that we live in a classless society. Surely class is about pre-judging someone, and that still continues today, as I'm sure it always will.</p>
<p>Maybe the answer really lies elsewhere. I'd suggest that the usual indicators of class would be family background, education, and employment. Whilst family background remains the same, further/higher education has higher percentage participation than ever, and the economic/industrial realignment of the country means that a lot more of us work in an office than in an industrial/physical/practical job. Maybe class is still there, we just don't quite know what the deciding factors are any more? Or maybe we do, but we don't feel able to articulate them. I'm thoroughly confused on the whole issue.</p>
