<p>I've been reading about a number of people's concerns about National Indentity cards. Up until now, I must admit, I hadn't given much thought to the matter, or been particularly concerned about my privacy and civil rights.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040209112145/http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32148.html">having just read an article on The Register</a>, I am definitely worried where society will be in 10-15 years. It isn't inconceivable that our ID card, credit card, cell phone, and electronic money will all be integrated, giving some with the inclination the ability to track us, see what and when we spend money, and basically draw up an itinerary of our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I object to that.</p>
