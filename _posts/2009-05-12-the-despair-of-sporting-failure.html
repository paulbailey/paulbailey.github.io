<p>I played cricket at the weekend, and I took my camera along to the match. Although we won (and it was a friendly game), I thought I'd highlight this photo.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what level, or how unimportant the match is, failing hurts. Simon look as though "he's just been dismissed for 98 at Lord's", to quote one person who saw the photo.</p>
<p>I think it sums up how everyone who's played any sport has felt at one time or another.<br /></p>
