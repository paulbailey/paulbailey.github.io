<p>...when I feel heavy metal...</p>
<p>Going to see Blur tomorrow in Hyde Park. I'm really quite excited, and I'm going with a friend I've know since we were 11. That means we've know each other for over 20 years, and it'll be cool to go with someone who I remember experiencing Blur when they were first about.</p>
<p>Roll on tomorrow evening!</p>
