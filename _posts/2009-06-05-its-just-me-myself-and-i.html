<p>In the past three weeks, I have been to:</p>

<li>A screening of an episode of The Corner, followed by a Q&amp;A with David Simon</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of Rob Brydon and podcast in Brighton, I've been along to all these events on my own. When I look at the list, I suppose it is fairly random. I'm not sure I could have found someone who'd go with me to quite a few of them anyway. I've come to the conclusion that I should be taking advantage of as much as possible whilst I'm living in a big city. Since I'm single, it's easier not to have to find someone to go with. The downside is that I'm quite a shy and nervous chap (yes, honestly!) so going to stuff on my own was more nervewracking, and in an odd way embarrassing, than you might expect.</p>
<p>Honestly though, it's been great fun. Apart from discussing a shared experience with someone afterwards, it's not really a disadvantage to be on your own. For a show, when the lights go down, we're all essentially on our own watching anyway. Either that, or we feel part of the audience as a whole, which is a large part of the attraction of going to a live event. Plus there's no guilt about dragging someone along to something they don't want to see.</p>
<p>So get out there and see stuff in the flesh!</p>
