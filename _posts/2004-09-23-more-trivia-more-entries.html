<p>Seems as though my blog has descended into one-liners about current events, and funny quotes I've come across. That's all well and good, but actually, I'm not too happy. I'm going to endeavour to post more often, but about less important things too. Like what I've been up to recently.</p>
<p>My fervent viewing of Kevin Smith's work continues apace. I saw Dogma and Chasing Amy a couple of years ago, but re-watched them recently, and realised how much I liked that stuff. Dogma, in particular, is a real favourite of mine. Surprisingly, Ben Affleck is pretty good in these films, and I'm starting to wonder if I disliked him because of all the stinkers he's been in. Anyway, I just bought Mallrats (Smith's worst film IMHO), which was actually fairly watchable. As for "An Evening With Kevin Smith", I haven't laughed out loud that much for ages. I really like this guy, and his work. Can't wait for the next film. Hell, I even enjoyed Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which works really well if you've seen all his other films. Can't imagine what it must be like if you haven't. There are a <strong>lot</strong> of in jokes.</p>
<p>On another note, I just got back from Munich, where we went for Ginge's stag weekend. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself (although I can't go into detail, what goes on tour stays on tour), and the Germans were actually very friendly. I've still not quite got my voice back!</p>
<p>I'm going to sign off for now, but I'll post a bit more this evening, when I get home.</p>
