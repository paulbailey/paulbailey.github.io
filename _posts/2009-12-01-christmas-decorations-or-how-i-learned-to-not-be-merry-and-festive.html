<p>In my inbox today at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear All</p>
<p>As the season of goodwill is now here, many of you may wish to enter the spirit of the season and decorate your desks and working areas. If so, for your own safety, please follow the following guidelines when installing Christmas lights, or any form of illuminated decorations.</p>
<ul>
<li>All illuminated decorations or Christmas lights plugged      into the floor boxes and mains must be 240 volts. Low Volt transformers      may be used</li>
<li>All of the above must carry a British Standard Kite      mark</li>
<li>All of the above must be fitted with a fused 3 pin plug</li>
<li>A maximum current rating of 5 amps must apply to the      above</li>
<li>Only one of the above may be plugged into any single      floor box, no matter how many sockets are available. This includes when      plugged into a multi way extension lead</li>
<li>All of the above will require PAT testing prior to use,      we can arrange that at the Facilities Service Point.Â  Test equipment      will be held by the maintenance department who will undertake testing on      request at a mutually acceptable time</li>
<li>All of the lights/decorations are to be switched off      when leaving the office in the evening</li>
<li>We have step ladders available at facilities. Please      ask for them rather than using your swivel chair</li>
<li>Do not hang decorations from or adjacent to lights or      points of heat</li>
<li>Take a look at the following link for HSE Guidelines. <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/nov07.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/nov07.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If in doubt please call the Facilities Service Point on ext 1444.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p></blockquote>
<p>Have fun during the festive period, everyone!</p>
