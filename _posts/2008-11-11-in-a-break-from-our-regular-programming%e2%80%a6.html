<p>… a film review-ette.  I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186201/">Bulletproof Salesman</a> last night, at the <a href="http://frontlineclub.com/club_videoevents.php?event=3337">Frontline Club</a>.  It was excellent, funny, and thought-provoking.  The Q&amp;A with the co-director, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875953/">Michael Tucker</a>, was very interesting too.  I’d thoroughly recommend seeing it.  In fact, it’s due to be shown in a shortened form (an hour) on BBC Four, as part of their Storyville season, in January.  Well worth a watch.</p>
<p>Here’s someone else’s <a href="http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2850&amp;reviewid=VE1117936532">longer review</a>.</p>
