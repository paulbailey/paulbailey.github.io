<p>Since I took up photography as a hobby last year, my biggest problem has been what to photograph. Strange as it may seem, this isn't as easy as you'd think. I've taken photos on overseas trips, but I'm always worried about spending too much time taking photos, and not enough time actually enjoying my holiday. I've taken a few shots of sporting events, the inestimably brilliant <a href="http://www.karaokecircus.com" target="_blank">Karaoke Circus</a>, but mostly I seem to have ended up taking sunrises/sunsets. They've come out pretty well, but I'd like to try other subjects.</p>
<p>I think I've found some I can have some fun with:</p>
