<p>A brief thought: It&rsquo;s a long time since I worked professionally on awebsite, but I do have some more recent amateur experience. I can&rsquo;tconceive of a problem which would cause a site to remain functional, butcompletely disable user authentication, let alone allow this to happenmultiple times.</p>
<p>Clever marketing, surely? It works on one level, because everyone rushesin to read Caitlin Moran&rsquo;s columns, but I&rsquo;d be interested to know if itactually increases subscriptions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to hear from anyone with more technical expertise whothinks this could be a genuine glitch, rather than just a publicitytactic. Of course, it could just be my cynical side showing itself. Yetagain.</p>
