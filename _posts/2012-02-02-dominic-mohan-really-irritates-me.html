<p>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/02/sun-editor-judges-privacy">today&rsquo;s Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>&hellip;[the law should be] rewritten with a clause that emphasises how sacred freedom of expression is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which can of course be expressed:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>the law should be rewritten with a clause that emphasises how sacred <strong>my right to decide how intrusive I want to be</strong> is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His readership doesn&rsquo;t like the Human Rights Act apparently:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Quite a few of our readers would be in favour of abolishing the Human Rights Act, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s nothing to do with the way he presents said law in his paper. He&rsquo;s always fair and balanced when it comes to discussing legal matters that impinge on his newspaper&rsquo;s business model.</p>
