<p>About four years ago, I had time to kill in Newcastle.</p>
<p>I went into HMV for a browse.</p>
<p>They were playing a song I hadn't heard before, but that I liked.</p>
<p>I used Shazam to find out what it was, and bought it on iTunes. That was easier than finding a shop assistant, then finding the CD, then queuing up to pay for it.</p>
<p>Hard for them to make a profit when they can't even guarantee the sale on an impulse purchase in their own store.</p>
