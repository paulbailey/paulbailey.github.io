<p class="p1">BBC News has published a story (actually posted last night) with the headline <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18102793">Met Police to extract suspects' mobile phone data</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The story is seeing some traction on Twitter this morning, so I thought I'd dig in a little, and see what I could find.</p>
<p class="p1">It appears that the system that the Met have bought is produced by <a href="http://www.radio-tactics.com">Radio Tactics</a>. From having a look at their site, my guess is that they've bought <a href="http://www.radio-tactics.com/products/law/aceso-kiosk">ACEOS Kiosk</a>. Looking at the <a href="http://www.radio-tactics.com/datasheets/rt-ds-ukv7-aceso-1332426274-1334334584.pdf">"full datasheet"</a>, the selling point of the system is pulling data from various electronic devices, and storing that data securely, with a full audit trail.</p>
<p class="p1">Thumbs up to that. If the police want to acquire this data, I want it to be secure. But what else is it doing? Actually, it's difficult to tell for sure, without a more comprehensive description. what does seem clear is that it understands the layout of data internally on lots of devices, in order to be able to extract (for example) text messages, IM conversations, and so on. The operator doesn't need to know anything about the internal implementation of the device to be able to extract and archive data on the phone.</p>
<p class="p1">What is less clear is whether it can bypass hardware encryption on these devices. My understanding is that all BlackBerry devices, all iOS devices from iPhone 3GS onwards, and recent Android devices (because of the fragmentation of this OS, it wasn't quite so clear which ones) encrypt, in hardware, all their data stored internally.</p>
<p class="p1">This means, that without a passcode, data can't be read directly from the internal storage. That read access would be how the product extracts information. Nowhere in the description of ACEOS does it detail cracking encryption like this. If it did, I imagine that would be a big selling point. Indeed, if this hardware encryption was easily cracked, that would be a big technology story too.</p>
<p class="p1">It seems far more likely to me that this product is about rapidly and efficiently extracting data that would have previously required a forensic specialist. I don't think that's a bad thing, and my guess is that it can't be done without your passcode anyway (you do have one set, don't you?).</p>
<p class="p1">If the police suspect that your phone has been used for criminal activity, then you'll be obliged to give them the passcode anyway (I think that not doing so is an offence). Encryption or not, they'll get onto your phone, if they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</p>
<p class="p1">So, onto retention of the data, and that's where the real problem is. From the original article:</p>
<p class="p2">A Met Police spokesman told the BBC that when a suspect was released, "data received from the handsets is retained and handled in accordance with other data held by the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]" - regardless of whether charges had been brought.</p>
<p class="p1">So actually, this isn't a technology story at all. If you refuse to give the police your passcode, or wilfully delete data from the phone, you've broken the law anyway. The latest devices have sufficient means to protect your data from casual extraction. The issue here is about data, and retention thereof, and we've been down this road with DNA, fingerprints, any information that the police might want to retain to make their job easier.</p>
<p class="p1">The solution to this particular problem is a change of policy, not a 79p app that enables you to destroy evidence.</p></p>
