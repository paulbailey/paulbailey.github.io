<p>So, I finally got to go The Fringe Sunday just gone, after an inital aborted attempt to plan this stuff. After <a href="http://www.wherediditallgoright.com/BLOG/2009/08/fringe-legs.html">Andrew Collins' extensive post on his trip</a>, I'm ashamed to admit I can't go into anything like as much detail, and I was only there for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I was flying up to Edinburgh on the 8am Gatwick flight, which meant I needed to get a bus from my flat at roughly 5:45. Being the consumate traveller, I prepared for this early rise by going out on the piss in Hampstead of all places, then consuming two bottles of wine in the cinema (Inglourious Basterds, less said the better) with my friend. Through in some more beers afterwards and dinner, and I got home at about 1am.</p>
<p>I deferred "packing" such as it was until the morning, and enjoyed 4 hours of alcohol-induced unconsciousness. Almost in a daze, I floated my way to Gatwick, and suddenly found myself in the middle of Edinburgh. Getting wet. A brief stroll around, a bite to eat, then it was time for the final <strong>Collings &amp; Herrin</strong> live podcast. I'd seen the guys do a turn live in Brighton, so I knew what to expect. Apart from how insufferably hot and humid it would be in there. Still, I throughly enjoyed myself, and after saying hello to a street trader (who looked remarkably like Andrew Collins), it was hotel check in time.</p>
<p>At this point, I have to confess that my plans of seeing a couple of shows in the afternoon were destroyed by the climactic Ashes moments, and the need for a power nap. Still, I deserved it. Sort of.</p>
<p>Fed and watered, and off to see <strong>Chris Cox</strong>'s <em>Mind Over Patter</em>. I really enjoyed it, as did the rest of the audience. So often mentalism is presented with a sort of gravitas that is meant to increase how impressed we are. To be honest, that always makes it worse for me. Cox's light touch with his presentation works really well with this type of act. Even if he does look 12.</p>
<p>After that, it was a rapidish stroll across to the Pleasance Courtyard to grab a swift alcoholic beverage, and get in the queue for <strong>Tim Key</strong>, and his show <em>The Slutcracker</em>. I had planned to see him anyway, but a friend recommended him very highly, and also insisted that I should sit front and centre in the audience, hence the queuing bit.</p>
<p>Well, what a treat. Setting a slightly edgy atmosphere with his entrance and quick change, the full show was captivated from start to finish. Whilst I didn't get the dubious pleasure of being Key's beer coaster, I did enjoy interacting with him a couple of times during the hour (at his behest I hasten to add), and the delivery was masterful. Thoroughly deserving of his nomination in the Eddies (and what a shit name that is).</p>
<p>Just next door then (after picking up another one of those refreshing beverages) to see the <strong>Penny Dreadfuls</strong> perform their new show <em>The Never Man</em>. A deliciously silly comedy thriller set in the newly built theme park on Beef Island, the threesome performed with a real gusto that was just right for a late night show. Some of the fight scenes certainly seemed to go beyond what was scripted, and a few  (what appeared to be) off-book lines and corpsing just added to a entertaining show. The best way I can describe it is that I wanted to be performing in it, it seemed to be such fun to do. Top work.</p>
<p>Apart from surprising a flyering Danielle Ward outside the show ("Karaoke Circus? No thanks, I'm already going"), I dashed off to my hotel to grab my camera equipment. Next on the agenda was the aforementioned KC, which was, as usual, bloody entertaining and hilarious. I really enjoyed trying to take photos in between laughing, singing along, cheering, and booing Dan Maier (in his Simon Cowell role). Great lineup, great band, great evening.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/observationsandmachinations/sets/72157622139044604/show/">More photos here</a>, if you're interested. I was pretty happy with them, given my accelerated lager consumption by this point in the evening.</p>
<p>I staggered home, tired and happy, and had another alcohol-induced period of unconsciousness for the second night running. Sadly, after waking, computer issues (trying to put a couple of photos online) and checking out (just really slow), I missed the midday show I wanted to see. Still the sun was shining, so I went to take a few quick touristy shots of Edinburgh, and grab some lunch.</p>
<p>As if by magic, I found myself in the Pleasance Courtyard again, in the sun this time, taking in the atmosphere, and a number of flyers (of course). One chap, <a href="http://www.sandersonjones.com/">Sanderson Jones</a>, did a good enough job to convince me to see his show in the afternoon, and my random quota was therefore fulfilled. I just had time to squeeze it in to my itinerary. Except I didn't really, and I ended up missing Pippa Evans. I actually surprised myself by only mis-scheduling once. Go me.</p>
<p>First it was <em>Book Club</em>, hosted, as ever, by <strong>Robin Ince</strong>. Cracking entertainment on the Free Fringe, and a most enjoyable hour. I wish I could remember everyone who performed, because they were all funny, but alas I have a poor short-term memory, and wasn't taking notes. I do however remember Foz Foster and The Baron from Karaoke Circus turning up, in full make up, to join in with the performance of the Crabs Musical at the end. Absolutely bbrrrriiiiillllliiiiaaaannnnttttt!</p>
<p>Dashed off to see the aforementioned <strong>Sanderson Jones</strong>, whose show is called <em>Another Heart Breaking But Ultimately Life-Affirming Show About Death</em> (I love the dark humour, what can I say?). It was actually pretty good, and worth seeing. Some of the material was a bit patchy, but his delivery and interaction with the audience suggest that he's only going to get better. Nice to see some personal stuff in there too, even if it looked like it might genuinely be a little upsetting for him to deliver.</p>
<p>So back to stalking <strong>Robin Ince</strong>, as I went to see his new show, <em>Robin Ince Vs The Moral Majority</em>. Ended up sitting right at the front, and heckling by mistake (rather like Withnail and his holiday) although it was all very good natured. It was a great show too, well observed and delivered, with lots of laughs. I genuinely left thinking 'How is he not on TV making millions, and someone with the same initials  as Marilyn Manson is?'. As ever, highly recommended.</p>
<p>Then an uphill sprint (literally) to get to <strong>Danielle Ward</strong>'s <em>Lies</em>. Despite my lightening pace, I didn't arrive quite in time, and had the ignominy of a late entrance. Still worse, there was a small audience, so I couldn't sneak in. As it transpired, it didn't matter too much, as Ward soon moved the audience around a bit in the shipping container we appeared to be sat in, so she could face in one direction as she went through the show. The audience which contained Martin White, Foz Foster and The Baron from KC. Again! I swear that these guys were following me around.</p>
<p>The show itself wasn't too dissimilar to the preview I'd seen, and enjoyed, in London the previous month, when Danielle was on a double bill with Richard Herring and Hitler Moustache. The difference being the smaller audience and 3 weeks of performing in Edinburgh to lukeward reviews. As I said earlier, I like my dark humour, and some awkward and tense moments are not necessarily a bad thing (see Tim Key). The jokes were quite wide-ranging, and on refreshingly different topics, and more hit and missed, with me at least. Oh, and anyone show that plays out to the Top Gun theme is alright by me! Nice shades too.</p>
<p>And so ended my flashtrip, with a slightly sad walk to the station to catch the sleeper train back to London (very good incidentally). I'd had a great time, hectic and amusing, and I didn't see anything that I didn't like. I'd call that a successful trip.</p>
<p>Blimey 1364 words?! That's more than I thought.</p>
