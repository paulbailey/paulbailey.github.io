<p>Just saw this quote:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>"It is a way of life that we all enjoy. We are still locked into the mindset that rising house prices are a good thing. It will be a good sign that we are moving to a more constructive way of thinking when we don't cheer every time house prices go up."</p></blockquote>
