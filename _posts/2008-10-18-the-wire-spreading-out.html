<p>Anyone that’s spent a few minutes talking to me about television knows what my favourite show is; <em>The Wire</em>. It’s the best US TV show I’ve ever seen, and amongst the more impressive from anywhere.  The Emmys however, have totally missed the show.  All that means to me is that I’m right about awards.</p>
<p>However, there is an indication that recognition is at least spreading a little.  In this current season, I’ve noticed more and more actors from <em>The Wire</em> appearing in other high-profile shows.  At the moment, we’ve seen Bubbles and Marlo in <em>Heroes</em>, as well as Herc and Spiros in <em>Entourage</em>.  I’m just wondering where Stringer and Avon will pop up…</p>
