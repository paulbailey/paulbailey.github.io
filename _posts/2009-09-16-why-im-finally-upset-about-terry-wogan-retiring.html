<p>I can't say I was too upset, or indeed surprised at the announcement that Terry Wogan was retiring from the Radio 2 Breakfast Show. I can remember being annoyed by being made to listen to him in the car on the way to school as a child, and his slow, lilting delivery never did much for me. It's fair to say that I was positively delighted when I heard that Chris Evans would be replacing him. Before his ego ran away with him in the late 90s, I thought he was an excellent DJ, and seemed to effortlessly be the sort of performer that Chris Moyles goes to sleep dreaming of being.</p>
<p>Overall then, I was pleased that someone I'd want to listen to in the morning was going to be on non-commercial radio again. All was right in the small, radio-oriented part of my mind.</p>
<p>Sadly this state of affairs didn't last. This week it was announced that Simon Mayo was moving to Radio 2 to fill the drivetime slot that Evans is leaving. I've always had a soft spot for Mr. Mayo, as he was the Radio 1 breakfast DJ of my teenage years. When he moved to the afternoon slot on Five Live (or whatever it was called then) in 2001, my respect for him went up several notches. He is now undoubtedly one of the country's finest speech broadcasters. Always formidably well researched (how he read so many of the books of authors he interviews, I'll never know) with a light touch, friendly but never obsequious, and not afraid to broach difficult subjects whilst simultaneously being non-confrontational, his shows, both live and podcast, have been a joy to listen to. The on-air partnership with Mark Kermode, resumed from 1 FM days, is a delight, with the niggling banter clearly unpinned by a great friendship.</p>
<p>He will, of course, be great in the drivetime slot, but won't be doing anywhere enough talking or interviewing for my tastes. Still, the saving grace is that we will still be getting two hours of wittertainment on a Friday afternoon. Maybe if Five Live weren't relocating to the Manchester area, things would have been different. Regardless, Radio 2 has gained a new listener, and Five have (just) retained one.</p>
