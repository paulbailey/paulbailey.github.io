  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I'm going to go for lyrical titles for my entries from now on. Makes thinking of a title easier. This one's pretty easy, particularly if you know where I've been this weekend.</p>
<p>Didn't see too much of the city, but that wasn't the real reason for the trip, so I can't say I'm too bothered. I'm writing this sitting in Nicky's flat in Vienna, but when I get the chance to post it, I don't know. Free WiFi hotspots don't seem to be very prevalent yet, so it might have to wait until I'm at home.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
Vienna Airport has a Wireless LAN, and it's free, so I can post this in transit. Works quite well actually, was a bit flaky where I first sat down, but now it's fine.</p>
<p>I feel a bit odd now, the weekend being over. Chances are I'm unlikely to see Nicky again, since she's off to SA in the new year. Very strange saying goodbye to someone for what could be forever. I felt quite emotional, which is a bit out of the ordinary for me. Oh well, nice to have had the chance to meet up.</p>
<p>The weekend was pretty cool actually, went to a Mexican bar as soon as I got into Vienna, with a load of Nicky's mates. Got relatively drunk, although most of them were really hammered, ended on dancing on the bar, and mixing my drinks as much as possible.</p>
<p>Sushi the next day for breakfast/lunch, then back to the flat, and vegging out in front of the TV. Quick wander around Vienna, couple of beers, then back to the flat, and watched Cube (very strange film), and Withnail &amp; I (very funny film).</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon was spent in various drinking establishments, which was pretty enjoyable, and then a Thai meal in the evening. All in all, I probably spent as much time in Irish bars as Austrian one, but when it comes down to it, they all have one thing in common. Alcohol.</p>
<p>I actually had a pretty relaxed and chilled out weekend, which was just what I needed.</p>
