  <article class="post-content">
    <p>So, via the medium to end all media (Twitter, in case you didn't know) I read [this blog entry](http://johnaugust.com/archives/2009/looking-back-on-amazonfail) today, via [@Glinner](http://twitter.com/Glinner). As a slightly implicated person (I mostly questioned how the situation had happened, and made jokes about being subverted by [@stephenfry](http://twitter.com/stephenfry) and his books) I don't feel embarrassed about my participation in the hashtag storm.</p>
<p>Whilst some people questioned and waited, and others jumped in with both feet, the facts remain thus. A large number of books from a particular genre were effectively removed from plain sight on Amazon's website.</p>
<p>Firstly, as cited in [@johnaugust](http://twitter.com/johnaugust)'s blog entry, even placing a large number of the affected titles in one genre is dubious. That's not the road I want to go down though. If Amazon does a poor job of grouping its titles, less potential buyers will view the appropriate books, and sales will fall. Their problem, and their choice whether to address it or not.</p>
<p>In my mind,two groups are to blame for what happened that fateful #amazonfail weekend. Them and us.</p>
<p>### Them<br />
Regardless of what products were affected, the fact that Amazon's systems allowed a single employee, operating in a single country capacity, to influence global listings is poor. Imagine that a less motivated, engaged, and internet-literate group of authors were detrimentally affected. How long might the error have taken to come to light? Doubtless sales would have fallen, and that's a measurable impact, to both authors and vendor. A single person's mistake far too easily affected "the bottom line". Amazon is a huge source of online sales, particular to "niche" authors, and I use the word with no disrespect. Which brings me to us...</p>
<p>### Us<br />
We're as much to blame as Amazon. Sure, their systems are flawed, and large changes can (apparently) happen to their multiple websites by accident, but on one level, that's their problem. The reason that their cock-up has such an impact on us is because we've chosen to put them in their dominant market position. Of course, there are online alternatives for buying books (or garden furniture, or shoes, or... the list goes on) but because Amazon are always competitive on price, we've flocked to them, and ceded a good deal of control of the market to the seller, not the buyer. Now, I could bemoan the demise of the net book agreement, or the fact that we don't support local independent bookshops, but I won't. Yes, in the UK, both of those things have made the situation worse, but there's something called a "credit crunch" going on, so perhaps all of us should be taking advantage of the economies of scale that massive online stores provide.</p>
<p>And that's the point really. All of us (and I'm chief among the culprits) who buy books from Amazon have put them in the position they're in today. I have easy access to lots of books that I might not have ever come across, thanks to Jeff Bezos' company and vision. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't police the way they present products to us. As a de-facto monopoly, if we don't, no one will.</p>
<p>There was no anti-gay, anti-whatever conspiracy, just human error, and a crappy computer system. This still meant books went missing, and we couldn't see all the products we should have been able to.</p>
<p>Even if it was for the wrong reasons, #amazonfail highlighted a glitch with the largest bookseller in the world, and caused them (I'm speculating here) to investigate and resolve the issue far quicker than might otherwise have happened. Can that be anything other than a good thing?</p>
