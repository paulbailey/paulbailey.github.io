<p><strong>Harry            Potter And The Childish Adult</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>By            A.S. Byatt</strong></p>
<p>New York Times<br />
11 July, 2003</p>
<p>What is the secret of the            explosive and worldwide success of the Harry Potter books? Why do they            satisfy children and — a much harder question — why do so            many adults read them? I think part of the answer to the first question            is that they are written from inside a child's-eye view, with a sure            instinct for childish psychology. But then how do we answer the second            question? Surely one precludes the other.</p>
<p>The easy question first.            Freud described what he called the "family romance," in which            a young child, dissatisfied with its ordinary home and parents, invents            a fairy tale in which it is secretly of noble origin, and may even be            marked out as a hero who is destined to save the world. In J. K. Rowling's            books, Harry is the orphaned child of wizards who were murdered trying            to save his life. He lives, for unconvincingly explained reasons, with            his aunt and uncle, the truly dreadful Dursleys, who represent, I believe,            his real "real" family, and are depicted with a relentless,            gleeful, overdone venom. The Dursleys are his true enemy. When he arrives            at wizarding school, he moves into a world where everyone, good and            evil, recognizes his importance, and tries either to protect or destroy            him.</p>
<p>The family romance is a latency-period            fantasy, belonging to the drowsy years between 7 and adolescence. In            "Order of the Phoenix," Harry, now 15, is meant to be adolescent.            He spends a lot of the book becoming excessively angry with his protectors            and tormentors alike. He discovers that his late (and "real")            father was not a perfect magical role model, but someone who went in            for fits of nasty playground bullying. He also discovers that his mind            is linked to the evil Lord Voldemort, thereby making him responsible            in some measure for acts of violence his nemesis commits.</p>
<p>In psychoanalytic terms,            having projected his childish rage onto the caricature Dursleys, and            retained his innocent goodness, Harry now experiences that rage as capable            of spilling outward, imperiling his friends. But does this mean Harry            is growing up? Not really. The perspective is still child's-eye. There            are no insights that reflect someone on the verge of adulthood. Harry's            first date with a female wizard is unbelievably limp, filled with an            8-year-old's conversational maneuvers.</p>
<p>Auden and Tolkien wrote about            the skills of inventing "secondary worlds." Ms. Rowling's            world is a secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked            derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature — from            the jolly hockey-sticks school story to Roald Dahl, from "Star            Wars" to Diana Wynne Jones and Susan Cooper. Toni Morrison pointed            out that clichés endure because they represent truths. Derivative            narrative clichés work with children because they are comfortingly            recognizable and immediately available to the child's own power of fantasizing.</p>
<p>The important thing about            this particular secondary world is that it is symbiotic with the real            modern world. Magic, in myth and fairy tales, is about contacts with            the inhuman — trees and creatures, unseen forces. Most fairy story            writers hate and fear machines. Ms. Rowling's wizards shun them and            use magic instead, but their world is a caricature of the real world            and has trains, hospitals, newspapers and competitive sport. Much of            the real evil in the later books is caused by newspaper gossip columnists            who make Harry into a dubious celebrity, which is the modern word for            the chosen hero. Most of the rest of the evil (apart from Voldemort)            is caused by bureaucratic interference in educational affairs.</p>
<p>Ms. Rowling's magic world            has no place for the numinous. It is written for people whose imaginative            lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting,            not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip.            Its values, and everything in it, are, as Gatsby said of his own world            when the light had gone out of his dream, "only personal."            Nobody is trying to save or destroy anything beyond Harry Potter and            his friends and family.</p>
<p>So, yes, the attraction for            children can be explained by the powerful working of the fantasy of            escape and empowerment, combined with the fact that the stories are            comfortable, funny, just frightening enough.</p>
<p>They comfort against childhood            fears as Georgette Heyer once comforted us against the truths of the            relations between men and women, her detective stories domesticating            and blanket-wrapping death. These are good books of their kind. But            why would grown-up men and women become obsessed by jokey latency fantasies?</p>
<p>Comfort, I think, is part            of the reason. Childhood reading remains potent for most of us. In a            recent BBC survey of the top 100 "best reads," more than a            quarter were children's books. We like to regress. I know that part            of the reason I read Tolkien when I'm ill is that there is an almost            total absence of sexuality in his world, which is restful.</p>
<p>But in the case of the great            children's writers of the recent past, there was a compensating seriousness.            There was — and is — a real sense of mystery, powerful forces,            dangerous creatures in dark forests. Susan Cooper's teenage wizard discovers            his magic powers and discovers simultaneously that he is in a cosmic            battle between good and evil forces. Every bush and cloud glitters with            secret significance. Alan Garner peoples real landscapes with malign,            inhuman elvish beings that hunt humans.</p>
<p>Reading writers like these,            we feel we are being put back in touch with earlier parts of our culture,            when supernatural and inhuman creatures — from whom we thought            we learned our sense of good and evil — inhabited a world we did            not feel we controlled. If we regress, we regress to a lost sense of            significance we mourn for. Ursula K. Le Guin's wizards inhabit an anthropologically            coherent world where magic really does act as a force. Ms. Rowling's            magic wood has nothing in common with these lost worlds. It is small,            and on the school grounds, and dangerous only because she says it is.</p>
<p>In this regard, it is magic            for our time. Ms. Rowling, I think, speaks to an adult generation that            hasn't known, and doesn't care about, mystery. They are inhabitants            of urban jungles, not of the real wild. They don't have the skills to            tell ersatz magic from the real thing, for as children they daily invested            the ersatz with what imagination they had.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of Ms. Rowling's            adult readers are simply reverting to the child they were when they            read the Billy Bunter books, or invested Enid Blyton's pasteboard kids            with their own childish desires and hopes. A surprising number of people            — including many students of literature — will tell you they            haven't really lived in a book since they were children. Sadly, being            taught literature often destroys the life of the books. But in the days            before dumbing down and cultural studies no one reviewed Enid Blyton            or Georgette Heyer — as they do not now review the great Terry            Pratchett, whose wit is metaphysical, who creates an energetic and lively            secondary world, who has a multifarious genius for strong parody as            opposed to derivative manipulation of past motifs, who deals with death            with startling originality. Who writes amazing sentences.</p>
<p>It is the substitution of            celebrity for heroism that has fed this phenomenon. And it is the leveling            effect of cultural studies, which are as interested in hype and popularity            as they are in literary merit, which they don't really believe exists.            It's fine to compare the Brontës with bodice-rippers. It's become            respectable to read and discuss what Roland Barthes called "consumable"            books. There is nothing wrong with this, but it has little to do with            the shiver of awe we feel looking through Keats's "magic casements,            opening on the foam/Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn."</p>
