  <article class="post-content">
    <p>To follow on from my <a href="http://blog.dreamshake.net/2009/06/once-again-im-out-of-step/">previous post</a>, I'm a lot cheerier today. I stayed up quite late last night, watching various social media sites, listening to the radio, and watching rolling news.</p>
<p>Seeing things unfold, particularly on Twitter, was very interesting. TV news really struggled to cover the event, since it was not strictly a "serious" happening. These rolling channels are usually able to fill time between the (usually sparse) nuggets of actually news by consulting various talking heads, who they normally characterise as "experts".</p>
<p>The problem was, "experts" on this particular topic comprised some <del datetime="2009-06-26T14:07:39+00:00">sycophantic</del> dedicated <del datetime="2009-06-26T14:07:39+00:00">nutters</del> hardcore fans, and the relentlessly self-publicising Uri Geller. Eventually we all agreed the man was dead, and then began to eulogise about his "musical genius". This seemed to be a point not even up for discussion. Now we were cutting to shots of crowds gathering, being talked at by the likes of Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on Twitter, most people were scrabbling around for jokes. Of course, it may have looked this way because of the people I choose to follow. There was the odd post about how sad it was, but even that was more than I expected to see. My worst fears were becoming realised. Public mourning was about to begin.</p>
<p>At this point, I felt a bit weird. I didn't care about him dying. I wouldn't wish anyone dead, and obviously he left children behind (I mean his children, don't try to make a joke there!) but I wasn't bothered either way. People die every day. It's just something we have to come to terms with. The traditional media coverage was leaving me out. Again.</p>
<p>Then I went to bed, woke up, went to work. Started to talking to people I work with. Interacting with some of my real-life friends via Facebook. Turns out, an awful lot of people feel like me. His death isn't a big deal. This isn't about his odd lifestyle choices, his multi-million dollar settlement of a child abuse case, and his plastic surgery, this is about a stranger dying. Millions of them do that every day. Just because he was famous shouldn't mean you're any more sad.</p>
<p>Look, if his death has upset you, I'm sorry. This isn't about attacking you or your feelings. This is about the media not representing the views of what I feel is probably the majority. It's not "good copy" (whatever that means) but it's the truth. Stop wallowing, report his death as a news story rather than a soap opera, and move on.</p>
<p>Right, I now promise not to say any more on the subject. Unless I do.</p>
