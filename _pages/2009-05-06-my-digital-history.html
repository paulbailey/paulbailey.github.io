<p>At the tender age of 33, I've been using a computer for 25 years. From the eight year old sitting in front of a Commodore 64, to the present day, with various Macs and PCs in different states of repair, I've spent the majority of my life with access to a computer.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>## The Commodore 64</p>
<p>Now, I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't one of the precocious computer urchins, writing my own relational database system before I was out of short trousers, I did tinker around on my C64. It certainly wasn't just a games machine to me, and I even had the odd go at writing my own entertainment. Sadly, my TIE fighter shooting game was both not very good and copyright-infringing. After graduating to Simons' Basic, I still laboured under the misapprehension that I had some software in me somewhere, but came up with nothing worth showing to anyone apart from my bemused, but slightly proud parents.</p>
<p>At this point, I was definitely losing a little interest in computers. Playing rugby was now an option, as well as my burgeoning interest in cricket (inspired by Imran Khan on TV, but that's another story). Rugby was more fun than football, since you could through yourself about a bit more, and even though I was pretty small at the time, I loved it. As a boy on the verge of his teenage years, I also noticed that girls were slightly more interesting than I though when I was first playing around on a computer.</p>
<p>My fundamental laziness is what drew me back into the world of computing. As my GCSEs approached, I realised that I had coursework to do, and handwriting anything over 150 words didn't really appeal. History exams were torture, and I've no doubt that the teachers attempting to decipher my scrawl were similarily pained. So, with a disc drive acquired for the C64 (which handily facilitated more sophisticated games), and a Citizen printer as a Christmas present, I entered the world of GEOS. This was a WIMP environment, as I remember them being called then, and enabled me to layout some fairly fancy looking documents. When I say fancy looking, I mean no mono-spaced fonts to be seen anywhere. Obviously by today's standards they still looked like crap. Still, the teachers seemed impressed (this was 1991 after all) and my parents clearly decided that I needed encouragement. This led to...</p>
<p>## The PC(s)</p>
<p>In a fit of ungratefulness, I don't exactly remember when I got the PC. It was certainly before 1994, as I can remember doing schoolwork on it for our Young Enterprise company. In fact, I remember some idiot at the regional final accusing us of getting our annual report done professionally, and not detailing how much it cost. I protested that I had done it myself, but to no avail. With hindsight, I suppose this the first time that I realised how much artifice poeple attached to working with computers. It really isn't rocket science people. Unless, of course, you're doing rocket science with the computers.</p>
<p>Undeterred, I eventually acquired a couple of laptops, the first a black and white Acer (I think), the next a second-hand Dell (which was at least 24-bit colour). The Acer got me through a year at Durham University (I think I even turned it on once) and that ran Windows 3.11. Even now, I shudder thinking about that. At least its monochrome aspect gives me the impression it was a long time ago. The Dell arrived a couple of year laters, after 12 months working in gainful (paid at least) employment. It had this spiffy new thing on it called Windows 95. This was a definite improvement, and for the first time, the computer became usable for work without endless tinkering. Or maybe I grew tired of the tinkering, it's hard to say.</p>
<p>Actually, it's not hard to say, because in my second year at Newcastle University, I distinctly remember downloading Linux (who knows what distro) onto a number of floppy discs, and installing it on the Dell. The tinkering hadn't stopped, although at this point I was no sort of coder, so after the initial "Wow, it looks like a *real* computer" when I booted into it, Windows soon went back on. However a change was coming...</p>
<p>## My Tangerine iMac</p>
<p>I had first looked at Macs several years before, when I coveted their sexy little laptops, which were way out of my price range, and I was stuck with my Dell. I wasn't enthused by them though, and aside from the aesthetic, I wasn't at all interested. After all, they were for creative people, and that wasn't me. Now though, computer use had gone through the roof at university, and waiting around for a PC terminal (they had more software than my laptop, not to mention a super speedy internet connection) was getting old. And there they were, at the end of the room, unused; a cluster of PowerMacs that were perpetually available. I suppose people are a little nervous of what they don't know, but my impatience got the better of me, so I sat down and tried to log in. Surprisingly, I was on straight away, all the same Microsoft software, my university e-mail, my stats package (SPSS), Netscape... What everyone else hadn't realised left me with a bank of computers to use whenever I wanted. These machines could be just as productive as the PCs I'd been used to. After an afternoon, I was used to the operating system, and work could commence. Sadly, in my case, work seemed to mean arsing around on the internet, such as it was in those days, but still, there I was. And that summer, fate intervened...</p>
<p>...in the shape of a couple of idiots who decided to beat me up after their night out. Peterborough city centre never held much interest for me at the best of times, but now I was sure. It was rubbish. Some stitches, and a little surgery to relocate my cheekbone, and I was right as rain. And clutching a Â£2,000 cheque from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Now half of it was wasted, doubtless on wine, women and song (but mostly wine) but the other half came to Bainbridges with me, and I lugged my beautiful new computer home with me.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe now, but in the dreary beige world of computing, this was about as sexy as a computer got. Which is admittedly not that sexy, but a step in the right direction. From this point on, all my personal computing was done on an Apple Macintosh.</p>
