<p>So I have a new book, [1000 things to do in London](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846700124). I’m going to post on this page when I do one of the activities.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>### BFI IMAX visit (May 26th 2009)<br />
I went to see Star Trek ([see what I thought about the film here](/2009/05/now-about-this-new-star-trek-movie/)) at the 11:30pm showing last Friday. Impressed with the screen, although the cinema could have been cleaner. Getting back to Putney from Waterloo at 1:45am was a shade more problematic…</p>
