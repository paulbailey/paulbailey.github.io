  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Another day, another change to the Facebook website, another round of whinging about it; just the way of thing in the 21st Century. Except that this time it's different.</p>
<p>Up to now, I haven't cared about any of Facebook's redesigns. I don't use the site that much, and in general the changes haven't affected the way I interact with it. This time around though it's different. We are receiving the gift of "frictionless sharing", and I think that's a bad thing. Here's why.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's <span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>privacy</strong></span>. The social media giant is keener than ever to accumulate information about you. It's well established now as a principle - if you aren't paying for a product that you use on the web, you're the product.&shy;</p>
<p>This new frictionless mechanism means that sites you visit and services you use are allowed, nay encouraged, to push data about what you're doing back to FB. Your friendly neighbourhood social network is soon going to have a LOT more information about you and your habits, and they already have plenty. Frictionless sharing is about making you as a product more valuable to sell. Of course, it has the added side effect of being pretty creepy as it happens.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's the <span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>noise</strong></span>. Right now, on Facebook, on Google+, and on Twitter, all the information I see is <em>curated</em>. That's to say, people have actively chosen to share it online. Provided I follow people who are smart, or interesting, or share interests with me, I will see plenty of interesting/informative/amusing content.</p>
<p>"Frictionless" in this context means "effortless". It means that the content that is coming through to Facebook didn't even require the click of a button. Sadly, that means that it didn't require any thinking either, and the person "sharing" it hasn't really thought about whether other people would like to see it. It's u<em>ncurated</em>. There is a strong chance that if this API takes off, the interesting things will be floating in a stream of Spotify plays and notifications that people have (in masochistic fashion) read the latest Melanie Phillips article.</p>
<p>Even if our friends from Palo Alto solve this problem, it'll still be a machine trying to decide what's interesting, not humans. I don't really care for that option.</p>
<p>In summary, I'm looking for a way to get all my contact information out of Facebook, delete everything from my profile, and leave. Guess what? They don't make that very easy either. They don't want their product leaving the store.</p>
