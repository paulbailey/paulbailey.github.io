  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Just a quick entry today. I toodled off to see a couple of Edinburgh previews this evening. I'd seen Hitler Moustache about a month ago at my local, and was interested to see how it might have changed over a month. Danielle Ward also did her show, Lies, to open the evening and despite being cold-ridden, was very funny. In fact, funny than I think she realised. A couple of times I felt as though there was some highly amusing material that she didn't give quite enough space/time (no, not a continuum) for. There was obviously a bit of work to do on the structure still, but I laughed the whole way through, and imagine it will be even better in 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Herring had changed his show quite a bit. There were some bits he removed (I think he already blogged about doing that) that didn't relate to the overall theme, and there was a lot more new stuff in there. I can say I thought that it was both interesting and funny four weeks ago, but it was even better this time around, and certainly felt more of a single piece, rather than standalone bits. I expect it will be well reviewed when it debuts in the Fringe.</p>
<p>I met a few similarly deranged people afterwards sporting Virgilio Anderson t-shirts, and I think we all felt a bit reassured that we didn't look like lunatics when there was more than one person wearing the bloody things. Of course, we looked like a cult instead, but that's a bit of a step up I think. Richard did his best to not look horrified to see us, and chatted for a bit at the bar before heading home.</p>
<p>Heading home was almost the most interesting part of the evening for me. I'd acquired a copy of the programme for the show, which features a quite frankly creepy picture of Mr. H on the front in full-on Mein Kampf mode. Well, I had already been to work, and thus in and around Hammersmith, in a t-shirt emblazoned with "Who Is Virgilio Anderson?". This being the case, I'd already thought that I knew what being a woman with large breasts must be like, as everyone, and I mean *everyone*, stared at my chest.</p>
<p>This did not prepare for the strange looks I got on the tube, clutching a programme which ostensibly had a picture of Hitler on the front. The woman sat next to me must have looked at it about 10 times, each time looking up at my face, and then back down at the photo again. She clearly objected, but hadn't realised I was watching her disgust in the reflection opposite. Initially I didn't mind, as I objected quite strongly to her overly tight powder blue pedal pushers, which I really felt weren't a good look for a woman in her 60s. Still, my bitter self-righteousness didn't last for long. I started looking around the carriage, and paranoia kicked in. Almost everyone was looking at me, and my apparently fascistic document. Of course, they may have been staring to try to see what the lettering said, but I was already sure I was causing some degree of offence. In an act of social awareness that would usually be anathema to me, I turned the programme over, revealing an advert for Scope. Hopefully that would confuse them, although realistically they couldn't make it out from more than two feet away.</p>
<p>I scuttled home from the station, and sat down with a new-found admiration for Richard Herring. If I'd been that bothered by carrying that on a 40 minute tube journey, what must have that moustache have been like for weeks and weeks? Honestly people, go and see the show, otherwise a middle-aged man's social awkwardness will have been for nothing!</p>
