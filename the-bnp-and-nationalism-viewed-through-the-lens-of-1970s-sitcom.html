    And no, not one of the obviously racist choices, like <em>Love Thy Neighbour</em>, but <em>Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads</em>.</p>
<p>This scene is from the classic episode <em><a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0747126/">No Hiding Place</a></em>, first transmitted on 20th February 1973, and written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais.</p>

I mean you get to these bitter northeasterlies in February, but we don't have to pack our possessions and flee south. That's why the British character is so stable. That's why we're so dogged, and relaxed, and calm under crises.

<p>Not only is it very funny, but it lampoons all of the silly, pointless things about racism, the sweeping generalisations, and the stupidity of drawing an arbitrary line in the sand, and saying "inside this is fine, outside is not". Why put the line where you do? For that matter, what's the point of the line?</p>
