Given the [latest in a long line of erosion of civil liberties in the
UK][], I thought I'd quickly post this tip so you can monitor who's
being with the data entrusted to them, and who's passing it on,
presumably for cash.

If you're a Gmail user, there's a little known trick you can use to
personalise your email address. Google ignores everything in the first
part of your address after a '+' sign, that is to say, as far as their
mail serversÂ are concerned, the following addresses will all be
delivered to Britain's latest Eurovision entry:

-   <div>
    <englebert.humperdink@gmail.com>
    </div>
-   <div>
    <englebert.humperdink+onlineshop@gmail.com>
    </div>
-   <div>
    <englebert.humperdink+mybank@gmail.com>
    </div>
-   <div>
    <englebert.humperdink+myregistrationatadodgysiteishouldnthavegivenmyaddressto@gmail.com>
    </div>

All you need to do is add an appropriate suffix when you give your
address to someone, and you'll know if they've shared it with someone
else simply by checking the 'To:' field on your emails. If you really
want to get clever, you can set up filters based around the different
addresses.
