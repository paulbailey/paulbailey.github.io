After last week's disappointing episode, this evening's was excellent.
It's rubbish really, because it seems very far-fetched (and the writers
had very little access to any kind of facts), but it's very enjoyable.

And it's about time Tom gave that American bird one. MI5 knocking the
back right out of the CIA!
