When Diana Spencer died, I was bemused. I wouldn't wish anyone dead, but
I couldn't understand all of the kerfuffle that went along with the
event.

It appears that Michael Jackson might be dead. Again, I don't really get
it. I was never his biggest fan, but the word "genius" is being bandied
around again. That word is over-used, and it's not appropriate here (in
my opinion).

Still, it's quite interesting watching the news unfold on social media,
the online press, and TV and radio. There's probably some more to be
said about the coverage, after this evening.
