A brief thought: It’s a long time since I worked professionally on
awebsite, but I do have some more recent amateur experience. I
can’tconceive of a problem which would cause a site to remain
functional, butcompletely disable user authentication, let alone allow
this to happenmultiple times.

Clever marketing, surely? It works on one level, because everyone
rushesin to read Caitlin Moran’s columns, but I’d be interested to know
if itactually increases subscriptions.

I’d also love to hear from anyone with more technical expertise
whothinks this could be a genuine glitch, rather than just a
publicitytactic. Of course, it could just be my cynical side showing
itself. Yetagain.
