This release seems to be from a law firm touting themselves as
availablefor comment, but it appears to confirm the details of the new
case being brought.

> Footballer CTB is suing Twitter

> LLPcomments:
>
> “Twitter Inc. and some of its users are being sued in the High Courtin
> London by the individual who obtained an injunction against The Sunand
> Imogen Thomas concerning allegations about his private life. In
> theinjunction action (see below), and in the new Twitter action, he
> isreferred to as "CTB”. The full case title of the new action is CTB
> v.Twitter Inc. and Persons Unknown. It is case no. HQ11X01814.
>
> The action was commenced on 18 May. The “persons unknown” aredescribed
> as those “responsible for the publication of information onthe Twitter
> accounts” but the latter are listed in confidentialappendices. It
> relates to the widely-reported posting on May 8 of aseries of “tweets”
> purporting to name a number of celebrities who hadobtained so-called
> super-injunctions, and describe the activitiescovered by the
> injunctions.
>
> It marks the first concerted attempt to deal legally with way in
> whichsocial media have of late been used an a vehicle for gossip and
> supposed‘information’ in an apparent attempt to undermine or evade the
> authorityof the High Court.
>
> The news comes in the week that sees judicial attempts to inject
> someclarity into a public debate which in the media at least has
> featuredwild and inaccurate comment about the perceived threat posed
> by “superinjunctions”. For one thing, the injunctions that have caused
> the debatearen’t super injunctions at all – the term was hijacked in
> the media torefer misleadingly to the injunctions obtained by
> celebrities whoseidentities were anonymised to enable the injunction
> to be effective. TheNeuberger Report (of the Committee on
> Super-Injunctions) was publishedon 20 May. It points out that in fact
> the Super-Injunction is an orderwhich prohibits (i) publishing
> confidential or private information AND(ii) publicising or informing
> others of the existence of the order andthe proceedings.
> Super-injunctions are reserved for exceptional casesand are only
> granted for very short periods, and only where this levelof secrecy is
> necessary to ensure that the whole point of the order isnot destroyed.
> Since January 2010, only two such super-injunctions havebeen granted,
> one which was set aside on appeal and the second which wasin force for
> seven days.
>
> That is not the case with the celebrity injunctions, which are
> termed“Anonymised Injunctions” i.e. the names of either or both of the
> partiesto the proceedings are not stated.
>
> In fact the principles of open justice are respected by
> AnonymisedInjunctions because, since the relevant parties are
> anonymised, a fulljudgment can be issued in which the judge sets out
> his reasons forapplying the balancing factors imposed by the Human
> Rights Act (right tofreedom of expression v right to respect for
> pricate and family life) inmaking the order. This strikes the balance
> between open justice, andappropriate protection of privacy where the
> judge has found that to berequired on the basis of the evidence put
> before him.
>
> This happened this week when Eady J published his judgment in the
> CTB‘Anonymised Injunction’ case itself. It should be

> by anyone thinking of commenting about theissue of Anonymised
> Injunctions, as it puts in context much ill-informedcomment which has
> obscured many of the real issues involved in thedeveloping (and still
> very young) law of privacy enacted by Parliamentin 1998 and applied by
> the judiciary."

> I would like to offer a spokesperson from Charles Russell LLP for
