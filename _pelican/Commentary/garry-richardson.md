I’ve just done the internet equivalent of changing channel (deleting a
podcast) because of this man. He obviously rates himself very highly,
and never fails to question his interviewees as per his own opinion.
 Some of his “journalism” around Dwayne Chambers and the Olympics was
nothing short of embarrassing.

Doubtless he thinks he’s asking the “tough questions”, but actually all
did was make his own opinion on the subject abundantly clear.  Some of
his sarcastic comments, like “thank you for finally answering that
question”, which he said to Lalit Modi this morning, really come across
as nothing short of professional.
