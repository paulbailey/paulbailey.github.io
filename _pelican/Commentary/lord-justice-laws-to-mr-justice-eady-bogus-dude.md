\*Not verbatim.

Let's all be very happy today. In the libel case brought by the BCA
against Simon Singh, there has been a dearth of good news. First the was
the ["astonishingly illiberal" ruling on the question of meaning at the
preliminary hearing][1], followed by a [refusal of Simon's application
for permission to appeal][2]. Today was his second attempt, by means of
an oral hearing, to secure leave to appeal the initial judgement on
meaning. It was successful.

Courtesy of [Index on Censorship's summary of the hearing][3], it appears
that Lord Justice Laws has robustly rejected Mr Justice Eady's
judgement, with phrases like "legally erroneous", adding that there was
"no question" of Simon's "good faith" in writing an article that was
"clearly in the public interest".

Let's not forget though, that although this is, to paraphrase, an
astonishingly robust and sensible ruling, it is still within the crazy
and embarrassing framework of English libel law. Whilst this is good
news for science in general, and Simon in particular, the wider battle
to reform libel law continues.

I urge you to add your name to the campaign.
