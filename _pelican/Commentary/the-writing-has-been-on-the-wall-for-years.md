About four years ago, I had time to kill in Newcastle.

I went into HMV for a browse.

They were playing a song I hadn't heard before, but that I liked.

I used Shazam to find out what it was, and bought it on iTunes. That was
easier than finding a shop assistant, then finding the CD, then queuing
up to pay for it.

Hard for them to make a profit when they can't even guarantee the sale
on an impulse purchase in their own store.
