Does anyone really care about the latest series of Big Brother?

Well, if you go by the viewing figures (7-8 million) for the first
episode, then this is set to be the biggest ever. At the risk of
sounding like an intellectual snob, this really is lowest common
denominator TV. Following on the heels of "Pop Idol", "Fame Academy",
"I'm A Celebrity, Resurrect My Career", the television industry is
proving that it knows how to flog a dead horse (see cookery, gardening
and home improvement shows for further details).

I am proud to say that I don't know any of the contestants' names, but
that will doubtless change over the next two months, as saturation
coverage continues. Channel 4 will be off-limits, except for the
cricket!
