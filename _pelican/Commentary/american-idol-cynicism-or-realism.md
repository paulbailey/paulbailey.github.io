Much as I hate to give any thought to it, I couldn't help but notice the
American Idol "resignation" of Paula Abdul (ostensibly over her wages).
The only reason I know anything at all about this is because of the
coverage afforded by her use of Twitter. More on that in a minute.

The reason it irks me is because the general public are being taken for
fools. Already it's being reported that she may be back on the show
after all, but that she'll miss a number of the audition recordings.
Isn't this exactly what they did with Louis Walsh a couple of years ago
on X Factor? "Sacked", and then asked back?

Am I being cynical? Or is that just the kind of clich√©d formula these
shows are always bound to follow?

I can't end on four rhetorical questions, so I'd better answer them.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
