From [today’s Guardian][1]:

Which can of course be expressed:

> the law should be rewritten with a clause that emphasises how sacred
> **my right to decide how intrusive I want to be** is.

His readership doesn’t like the Human Rights Act apparently:

> Quite a few of our readers would be in favour of abolishing the Human
> Rights Act, that’s for sure.

Of course, that’s nothing to do with the way he presents said law in his
paper. He’s always fair and balanced when it comes to discussing legal
matters that impinge on his newspaper’s business model.
