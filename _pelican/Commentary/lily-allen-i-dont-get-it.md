..and not the way you think.

I’m not what you’d call up to date with pop music. I don’t listen to
Radio 1 regularly, and my musical tastes have tended towards going back
in time, rather than forwards. Still, I haven’t been living in solitary
confinement for the past five years, so I know who Lily Allen is.

Now I’ll be the first to admit I’m not the biggest fan of her music.
It’s not at the top of my playlist, but I have listened to it, and I
thought it was perfectly fine pop music. Lily seems to be credited as a
co-writer on all the tracks, so she’s involved creatively from the
beginning in her songs. Whilst she might not have an amazing voice, it
definitely has charm and character. That alone sets her apart from the X
Factor style of singing that grates with me so. She’s a successful,
young, forthright, honest British woman, just the sort of person you’d
think might be very popular with the press.

Yet she still seems to invoke vitriol in a lot of people in the public
and in the media. That’s what I don’t get. Every time I’ve seen her on
TV, she seems quite down-to-earth, and her [Twitter account][1] (which is
thankfully not a PR-run thing) shows a decent sense of humour, and an
endearing amount of vulnerability, particularly to some of the nastier
criticism.

Yes, she has a famous dad. Yes, she goes out in the evening, and has a
drink. Is that the reason why people don’t like her? Maybe. There’s an
accusation that she pretends to be street, when she went to a private
school. Firstly, I’m not sure that’s something she’s ever pretended to
be, and secondly, what does her schooling have to do with anything?

I’m not writing this piece as defence of Ms Allen, that’s hardly
necessary. it’s much more of a question. What’s so annoying about her?
