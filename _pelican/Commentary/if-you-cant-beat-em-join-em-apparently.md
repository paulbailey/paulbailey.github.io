Just heard this story breaking where I usually hear new stuff (don't
make me use the T word). Edgar Wright, director of Spaced, Shaun of the
Dead and Hot Fuzz amongst other things, wrote a lovely blog post about
working with the late Edward Woodward several days ago. I read it at the
time, and thought it was a moving piece. [Edgar's thoughts on the
departed Mr Woodward][1].

[It seems that The Times thought so too][2]. Which was nice. Except they
didn't ask Edgar if they could use his piece, and to add insult to
injury, have sub-edited it in a [manner that he feels misrepresents
him][3]. Oh dear.

And all this from an organisation that [plans to sue Google and the BBC
for stealing their content][4].

Well, it's a new online business model at least. Nick the content, then
charge for it.

*EDIT - I've just seen [via The Guardian website][5] that it was in the
print version of the newspaper. Even worse.*
