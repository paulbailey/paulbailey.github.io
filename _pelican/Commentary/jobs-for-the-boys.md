Just reading Nick Clegg's article in the Standard. Earlier in the day,
somewhat unfairly, I might have called him a hypocrite, because he had
benefited from an internship organised by his father's friend.

Then I noticed something about his article. He claims:

> "who you know is becoming increasingly more important than what you
> know"

I am not a banker (whatever that means exactly), but I do work in the
City, and I have done on and off for the last 6 years. I would say it is
generally accepted that, if anything, the old boy's network is *less*
influential these days.

The globalisation of the finance industry means working practices have
changed noticeably over the last few decades. Incidentally, the
Americans are usually blamed for this shift, but that's probably unfair
too.

Clegg very probably has a point, but to suggest the Square Mile is less
of a meritocracy now than in, say, the 1960s? I find that very hard to
believe.
