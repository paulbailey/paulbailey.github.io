If political parties want us to use a voting system where we express
anordered preference with multiple votes (whether for parties
orcandidates), perhaps we should ask them to put their policies in
theorder that theyâ€™ll jettison them when they choose to become part of
acoalition.

Or I am being entirely unfair?
