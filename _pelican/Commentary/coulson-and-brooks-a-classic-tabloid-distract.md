"I'm guilty."

Those could be the words that you're hoping to hear from Rebekah Brooks,
or perhaps Andy Coulson. If you're optimistic, perhaps even James
Murdoch, or Heaven forbid, his father Rupert. Sorry (and that might be
another one you're waiting for) but it's me that is saying them.

Like most liberal-minded people in the UK, I can't stand Rupert Murdoch
and his principles. His tabloid papers are unpleasant, morally bankrupt
publications, and his influence on the politics of this country for his
own financial benefit disgusts me. The Mulcaire story, after being swept
under the carpet quite effectively, exploded this week, and I was
delighted and fascinated.

Then the games began. News International handed e-mails to the police
which resulted in the arrest of an ex-editor of theirs, and two others.
Rebekah Brooks, editor at the time of the Dowler phone-hacking, is a
focus of huge attention. Â Many people (rightly in my opinion) want to
use this as an opportunity to limit Murdoch's control of the media in
this country.

And then they closed News of the World.

This didn't concern me particularly. It wasn't a paper I chose to read,
and I feel that the world is probably a better place without it. And
then the complaining/defending started from the ex-employees.

Now, I don't blame them one bit. People losing their job should never be
a cause for celebration, and I'm not prepared to tar them all with the
same brush (a practice that their newspaper wasn't concerned about
using). Their line of defence is roughly as follows:

> We're being punished for the crimes of our precedessors. We don't do
> those sorts of things. We weren't involved. This is a great newspaper.

Now, they may have stopped using the "Dark Arts". I really don't know.
What I do know, is that the Daily Mail has piled into the debate, with
an awfully superior tone to its editorial. I'm sure they can't speak
from a position of authority on this. These two things reminded me that
the debate should be a lot broader than it is.

Last year, I read Nick Davies's excellent book [Flat Earth News][1],
which I heartily recommend. In particular, the chapter "Dark Arts" is
quite clear. Based on his own investigations (and he is the Guardian's
reporter on the Mulcaire revelations) and the details in the
[Information Commissioner's report][2], all manner of illegal activities
are widely used at both tabloids and broadsheets.

News International would like to concentrate the blame on one newspaper,
and if necessary one or two individuals. The rest of the press would
like to concentrate on News International.

So whilst we are right to be disgusted at the relevations of the past
week, there are things we should remember:

-   Just as it wasn't a rogue reporter, the News of the World wasn't a
    rogue newspaper.
-   This type of activity isn't ancient history
-   Other newspapers have a vested interest in the reduction of
    Murdoch's power

Let's not make this story just about News International, Rebekah Brooks
and Andy Coulson; to do that would be to miss a massive opportunity to
clean up a problem that's existed for years, unnoticed by almost all of
the public.
