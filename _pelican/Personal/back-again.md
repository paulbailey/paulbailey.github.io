I'm going to make a concerted effort to try to make more, and better
entries here. After my extended diatribe about last weekend (I'm still a
bit confused about everything that happened?!), back to happier things.
Hopefully Houston is coming together for a holiday in December, off to
London for the weekend, and the Deeping basketball season is almost upon
us again.

Cool!
