A belated Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year to everyone who
occasionally reads this blog (which, surprisingly, is up to double
figures by all accounts). I'm back at work today, which is a bugger, but
there's not a huge amount happening today.

Saw a few people I haven't seen for ages at a school reunion on the
27th, which was cool. I'll do another entry this afternoon, detailing a
bit more about the evening...
