...when I feel heavy metal...

Going to see Blur tomorrow in Hyde Park. I'm really quite excited, and
I'm going with a friend I've know since we were 11. That means we've
know each other for over 20 years, and it'll be cool to go with someone
who I remember experiencing Blur when they were first about.

Roll on tomorrow evening!
