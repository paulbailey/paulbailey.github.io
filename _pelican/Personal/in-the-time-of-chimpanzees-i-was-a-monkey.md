Saturday night in, alone and ill... hence the particular lyrical title.

Had lunch with Helen today, which was great. Sometimes you look back,
and wonder... but then sometimes I wonder how life has conspired to
ensure that I'm not (currently) rich and famous!

Anyway, real reason for my post: If you're obsessed with music, a bit
like me, this site is **very** cool! [Coversproject.com][] lists all
songs that an artist or band has covered, and all of their songs that
someone else has covered. Very entertaining, and is certainly whiling a
few hours away this evening.
