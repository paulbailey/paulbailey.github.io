I'm out and about on my travels this week... heading down to London for
a couple of days for a dull training course (and taking the opportunity
to have some beers whilst I'm down there), then it's off to Vienna for a
long weekend.

Really looking for to that, actually, it'll be good to leave this
sceptred isle again, since it's been a while. Not to mention I'm
visiting Nicky, who I have hardly seen since I left university. Should
be a good laugh!
