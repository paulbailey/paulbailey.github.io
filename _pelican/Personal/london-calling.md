... with apologies to The Clash for this entry's title!

Now, I have always said that I didn't think I was a big city person.
Nice to visit, but terrible to live in. Having been to London a lot over
the past 6-7 years, maybe I'm wrong. In a strange way, I actually feel
at home here. Not just because I have quite a few friends in and around
the place, but actually travelling around the city, I feel comfortable.
I'm sure the day-to-day grind is something that might get me down, but I
think I'm going to have to give it a try. Another 12 months Oracle/PLSQL
experience will stand me in good stead, I think.

Going to Vienna tomorrow. Looking forward to it now, and starting to get
excited about flying on a proper plane. Think the pilot will let me look
in the cockpit? :)
