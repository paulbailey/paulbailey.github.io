Well, in a week's time I should be landing at Philadelphia International
Airport, and then catching a flight on to West Palm Beach. It's been a
while since I've been on holiday (over two years actually), so I'm
getting quite excited now. Hopefully the weather will be good, the beer
will flow, and I'll have an entertaining, relaxing time!
