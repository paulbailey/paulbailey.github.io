I'm going to go for lyrical titles for my entries from now on. Makes
thinking of a title easier. This one's pretty easy, particularly if you
know where I've been this weekend.

Didn't see too much of the city, but that wasn't the real reason for the
trip, so I can't say I'm too bothered. I'm writing this sitting in
Nicky's flat in Vienna, but when I get the chance to post it, I don't
know. Free WiFi hotspots don't seem to be very prevalent yet, so it
might have to wait until I'm at home.

**Update:**  
Vienna Airport has a Wireless LAN, and it's free, so I can post this in
transit. Works quite well actually, was a bit flaky where I first sat
down, but now it's fine.

I feel a bit odd now, the weekend being over. Chances are I'm unlikely
to see Nicky again, since she's off to SA in the new year. Very strange
saying goodbye to someone for what could be forever. I felt quite
emotional, which is a bit out of the ordinary for me. Oh well, nice to
have had the chance to meet up.

The weekend was pretty cool actually, went to a Mexican bar as soon as I
got into Vienna, with a load of Nicky's mates. Got relatively drunk,
although most of them were really hammered, ended on dancing on the bar,
and mixing my drinks as much as possible.

Sushi the next day for breakfast/lunch, then back to the flat, and
vegging out in front of the TV. Quick wander around Vienna, couple of
beers, then back to the flat, and watched Cube (very strange film), and
Withnail & I (very funny film).

Sunday afternoon was spent in various drinking establishments, which was
pretty enjoyable, and then a Thai meal in the evening. All in all, I
probably spent as much time in Irish bars as Austrian one, but when it
comes down to it, they all have one thing in common. Alcohol.

I actually had a pretty relaxed and chilled out weekend, which was just
what I needed.
