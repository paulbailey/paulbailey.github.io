I'm off to see a lot of cool live stuff on the Isle of Wight, at
Bestival. It's not huge like Glasto, but it has an [amazing
lineup](http://www.bestival.net/html/artists/2009lineup), and the
weather's set fair too.

I've had a pretty average last couple of weeks, and this is just the
tonic I need. Now, if only I knew someone with a helicopter, so I didn't
have to get up in five hours...

See you all on the flipside!
