Well, I haven't written an entry in a couple of weeks, I've been a bit
slack because I've been extremely busy. My birthday was good fun, and
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday were very entertaining nights
out. Cost me a few quid, but hey, it was worth it!

My usual round of trips to London on training courses are due to
re-commence soon, so I'll doubtless have to find some more entertaining
stuff to do! I've also found that my phone has a broken "1" key, so I'm
having to get a bloody replacement for that. I can't say that I'm hugely
pleased about that extra expense.

On the plus side, I've got my new mini PC set up, and it is working like
a charm with my TV, and recording FreeView programmes. Point and click
recording is very cool, and being able to burn it to DVD is fairly handy
also.
