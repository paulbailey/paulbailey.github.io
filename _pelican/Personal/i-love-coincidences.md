When they're funny, it's even better.

It started with a bit of Facebook banter. My friend had set his status
as:

'Dan has just bought a Dire Straits album. Does that make me a bad
person?'

Me: 'It's a cheaper early mid-life crisis than a motorbike.'  
Dan: 'Alright, alright! It was only for research purposes anyway...'  
Me: 'Ah, the Pete Townshend defence.'  
Me: '(is that joke in bad taste? Can't tell these days)'  
Dan: 'Thanks for using my status page as a space to experiment with
your sick brand of humour Paul ;)'

What really made me laugh was Spotify throwing up *The Kids Are Alright*
by **The Who** literally 10 seconds after this exchange.

Simple things...
