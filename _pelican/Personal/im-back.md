Well, I've been very lax recently, not posting to my blog, and generally
feeling a bit sorry for myself. Aside from a bit of entertainment at
work (more about that in a later post I think) I've actually found it
difficult to adapt to being single again. Out of practice I suppose.
Anyway, I had started to consider options that really wouldn't have been
options a couple of years ago.

Suddenly though, I woke up on Sunday, and all was right with the world.
I've remembered how to be single, and remembered that I did once have
standards (hard though that may be to believe!) and I no longer need to
derive comfort from those who are even worse off than me.

I have a horrible cold at the moment, but even that has failed to dampen
my spirits. I'm changing my job a bit too, and that is definitely
something to look forward to. Now if only my lottery numbers would come
up, everything would be perfect...
