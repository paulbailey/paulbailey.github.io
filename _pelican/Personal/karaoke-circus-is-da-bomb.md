Just a swift note about last night's entertainment. I was at the
[legendary][] [100 Club][], to see [Karaoke Circus][]. It was absolutely
bloody marvellous. I'd do a review, but I have a memory like a sieve,
and plenty of people have posted about it already. Like:

-   [One of the performers][]
-   [The winner of the open mic spot][]
-   [One of the hard-working musical geniuses behind the evening][]

[I took some photos.][] They're playing [Latitude festival][], and at
Edinburgh too. Get there. Seriously.
