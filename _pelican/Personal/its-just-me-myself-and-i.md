In the past three weeks, I have been to:

-   [Rob Brydon live in the West End][]
-   [A public support meeting for Simon Singh][]
-   [Skeptics in the Pub, with Professor Edzard Ernst as the speaker][]
-   [Tony Benn doing a talk/Q&A][]
-   [Collings and Herrin's live podcast in Brighton][]
-   Henry Blofeld and friends celebrating his 70th birthday at the Royal
    Albert Hall
-   [The Dodge Brothers Go West - White Oak, a silent western at the
    Barbican with live musical accompaniment][]
-   A screening of an episode of The Corner, followed by a Q&A with
    David Simon

With the exception of Rob Brydon and podcast in Brighton, I've been
along to all these events on my own. When I look at the list, I suppose
it is fairly random. I'm not sure I could have found someone who'd go
with me to quite a few of them anyway. I've come to the conclusion that
I should be taking advantage of as much as possible whilst I'm living in
a big city. Since I'm single, it's easier not to have to find someone to
go with. The downside is that I'm quite a shy and nervous chap (yes,
honestly!) so going to stuff on my own was more nervewracking, and in an
odd way embarrassing, than you might expect.

Honestly though, it's been great fun. Apart from discussing a shared
experience with someone afterwards, it's not really a disadvantage to be
on your own. For a show, when the lights go down, we're all essentially
on our own watching anyway. Either that, or we feel part of the audience
as a whole, which is a large part of the attraction of going to a live
event. Plus there's no guilt about dragging someone along to something
they don't want to see.

So get out there and see stuff in the flesh!
