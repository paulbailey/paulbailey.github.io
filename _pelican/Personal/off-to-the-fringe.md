So, it's 8:45, and I'm in the air over Birmingham (according to the
reassuring voice of the captain). I've been up for 3 1/2 hours now, and
despite drinking until midnight, and going to bed at 1am, I feel
surprisingly good.

I've just realised in my haste that I booked a ticket for Chris Cox's
show on Friday, rather than today. Hope it isn't sold out, as I'm really
keen to see it.

Annoyingly, the cricket is poised to be interesting today, so I may be
distracted during the afternoon, we'll have to see. As the last thing
I'm booked to see today is due to finish at 2:30am, I'll have been awake
for roughly 22 hours on 4 hours of drunken sleep. I'm actually
interested to see how grumpy I am tomorrow!

On a more whimsical note, and this may be an indication of my tiredness
already, I'm attending the Edinburgh fringe with possibly the longest
fringe I've had in a decade. God, that is awful. I'm definitely tired.
May need to find a park bench to sleep on this morning before I can
check into my hotel!
