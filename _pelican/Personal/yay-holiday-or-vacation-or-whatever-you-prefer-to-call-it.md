Any recommendations for where we can go in Boston?  New York already has
quite a long list of things to see and do in a few days…

I love last minute holidays.  Maybe this one isn’t quite last minute,
but the details are coming together less than a month before I go.

(Before anyone tries to be funny, no not Boston, Lincolnshire!)
