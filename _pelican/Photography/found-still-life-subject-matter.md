Since I took up photography as a hobby last year, my biggest problem has
been what to photograph. Strange as it may seem, this isn't as easy as
you'd think. I've taken photos on overseas trips, but I'm always worried
about spending too much time taking photos, and not enough time actually
enjoying my holiday. I've taken a few shots of sporting events, the
inestimably brilliant [Karaoke Circus][], but mostly I seem to have
ended up taking sunrises/sunsets. They've come out pretty well, but I'd
like to try other subjects.

I think I've found some I can have some fun with:

More to come, I think ...
