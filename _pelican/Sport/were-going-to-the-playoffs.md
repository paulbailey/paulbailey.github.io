Well, my up-and-down association with the Houston Rockets looks like it
might last a little longer than has been normal for the past few years.
Jeff Van Gundy, and his NY-style defense, looks set to take the Rockets
into the playoffs for the first time in five years.

Of course, a 7' 6" Chinese national has something to do with that, but
the team as a whole seems to be functioning more effectively around Yao
Ming, and if Steve Francis continues living up to his potential, I've
got considerably higher hopes for the team than most of their fans. Good
luck guys!
