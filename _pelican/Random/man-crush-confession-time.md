I think Peter Serafinowicz is very funny. I don't know why the BBC
didn't commission another series of his sketch show. Fools. They'll
regret that come Judgement Day. Which for the BBC is likely to be the
day after the next election. Little bit of politics there.

Amongst other things, he's a great impressionist. I'm a huge Beatles
fan, and he does all four of them brilliantly. This is his Fab Four
parody on the [excellent Funny or Die UK website][]:

If you're a Twit (or a "twat" as David Cameron likes to call us) get
following him, he's [@serafinowicz][]. His brother (who produced The
Peter Serafinowicz Show) is apparently "Head of Content" at Funny or Die
UK. He's [@flidby][] on Twitter.
