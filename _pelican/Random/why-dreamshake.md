Well, [this link][1] describes the basketball player that inspired me to
use the expression. [Phil Taylor's article on CNNSI.com][2] describes the
move itself. I'll just give you an extract:

*The beauty of Hakeem Olajuwon's move is its countless variations. Like
snowflakes, no two Dream Shakes are exactly alike. "He steps in, gives
you three or four fakes, goes up and under or goes to the fadeaway,"
says Heard. "You don't know what shot he's going to take because he has
them all combined."*

*It seems odd that the most graceful, fluid move in the league would
belong to a center. When Olajuwon was learning the game, he studied not
just centers but also forwards and guards, and it's obvious he has
incorporated into his game moves that typically belong to smaller
players. He goes through a series of spins, fake spins, pump fakes and
up-and-under moves until the defender finally bites. Then Olajuwon can
finish off the move with a fadeaway jumper, a short jump hook or a
dunk.*
