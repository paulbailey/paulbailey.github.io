And no, not one of the obviously racist choices, like *Love Thy
Neighbour*, but *Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads*.

This scene is from the classic episode *[No Hiding Place][]*, first
transmitted on 20th February 1973, and written by Dick Clement and Ian
La Frenais.

  Bob:     Out there, where they've had all that terrible flooding, tragic. Thousands homeless.
  Terry:   That's to our advantage isn't it, heavy pitch?
  Bob:     What a terrible thing to say! What an inhuman attitude!
  Terry:   Well, they know how to cope with floods and such like out there, they're used to that sort of thing. Catastrophe's a way of life for them.
  Bob:     And what does that ridiculous remark mean?
  Terry:   Well, all them countries over there, all them places like [inaudible] and Bulgaria and the Middle East. They're all unstable. If they're not having floods, it's earthquakes, if it's not earthquakes, it's typhoons. That's what makes the people so unstable. That's why they're always so hysterical. Always leaping up and down, and wanting a war, or change of government or something.
  Bob:     Are you seriously putting that forward as a theory of national character?
  Terry:   Certainly! It's true! Now you take Britain; we don't get earthquakes or tidal waves or anything, do we? I mean you get to these bitter northeasterlies in February, but we don't have to pack our possessions and flee south. That's why the British character is so stable. That's why we're so dogged, and relaxed, and calm under crises.
  Bob:     But according to you we don't get any crises!
  Terry:   We don't. But if we did, we would be calm under them.
  Bob:     I'm learning a lot about you today. I bet we could go right round the world and you'd have a pat response ready.
  Terry:   I've travelled man. I've seen a bit of the world now you know.
  Bob:     Well, what do you think of... Koreans for instance?
  Terry:   Not to be trusted. Cruel people. Much the same as all Orientals.
  Bob:     Well, that's a third of the world's population dismissed in a phrase. Russians?
  Terry:   Sinister.
  Bob:     Egyptians?
  Terry:   Cowardly.
  Bob:     Oh, I thought you might have saved that for Italians.
  Terry:   No no no, they're greasy aren't they? Not as greasy as the French, mind.
  Bob:     Germans?
  Terry:   Arrogant.
  Bob:     Spaniards?
  Terry:   Lazy.
  Bob:     Danes?
  Terry:   Pornographic.
  Bob:     Well, that's just about everyone. Oh, Americans?
  Terry:   They're flash aren't they?
  Bob:     So it's just down to the British is it?
  Terry:   Well, I haven't got much time for the Irish or the Welsh. And the Scots are worse than the Koreans.
  Bob:     And you never could stand Southerners.
  Terry:   To tell you the truth, I don't much like anyone outside this town. There's a lot of families in our street I can't stand either. Come to think of it, I don't even like the people next door.
  Bob:     I see, so from the distant blue Pacific, through the barren wastes of Manchuria, to 127 Inkerman Terrace, you can't abide anyone. How you came to marry a German girl I'll never know.
  Terry:   The failure of my marriage only goes to prove my point. Them and us don't mix. England should take heed of the failure of my entry into Europe. God didn't make this country a island by accident you know.
  Bob:     I see. So to sum up, the British are calm under a crisis, the rest of the world is unstable, and all hairdressers are fairies?
  Terry:   Except Tommy Mossop.
  Bob:     Oh, except Tommy Mossop.

Not only is it very funny, but it lampoons all of the silly, pointless
things about racism, the sweeping generalisations, and the stupidity of
drawing an arbitrary line in the sand, and saying "inside this is fine,
outside is not". Why put the line where you do? For that matter, what's
the point of the line?
