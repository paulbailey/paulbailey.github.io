...for [The Atheist's Guide to Christmas][] book!

Now, I've not blogged about religion much. This is primarily because I
find listening to other people's religious beliefs quite tedious, and
from this I've inferred that other people would find my views similarly
uninteresting.

I am (and this is no surprise to people who know me) an atheist. If you
push me, I'd probably describe myself as a secular humanist. I've got a
confession to make though: I've always enjoyed Christmas. The religious
aspect always seemed rather silly to me, but a festival in the
middle(ish) of winter is a great idea. Of course, this idea predates
Christmas anyway. Everyone being that little bit nicer to each other,
eating, drinking and making merry is something that will always get my
support.

This book is in that same spirit with a set of contributions from
godless people like Derren Brown, Charlie Brooker, David Baddiel,
Richard Herring and other writers, comedians and scientists (42 in
total), all revolving around Christmas.

Oh, and did I mention the advance and royalties from the book are going
to the Terence Higgins Trust? What more reason do you need to go out and
buy it? I did. Perhaps you'd even like to [get involved][]...
