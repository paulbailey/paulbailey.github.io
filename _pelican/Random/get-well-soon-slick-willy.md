[Bill Clinton is recovering after his successful heart bypass

I'd like to express my best wishes to him, and his family, during his
recovery period. Regardless of his philandering, and his occasional
vanity, he was an excellent president, and a credit to his nation. An
extremely intelligent and well-informed man, he understood the global
nature of political problems in the 20th century, and contributed
immeasurably to a development of closer relations between the US and
other nations (there is often a larger gap than people in the USA
sometimes imagine). He was easily the most popular president outside US
borders for many years.

As the youngest ever ex-president, he is a charismatic and *articulate*
public speaker, funny and relevant at the same time. Anyone who saw his
speeches at both the Labour and Democratic party conference would see
the effect he could have on a crowd.

All the best, Bill!
