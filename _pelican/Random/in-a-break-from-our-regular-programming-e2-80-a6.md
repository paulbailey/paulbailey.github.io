… a film review-ette.  I went to see [Bulletproof Salesman][] last
night, at the [Frontline Club][].  It was excellent, funny, and
thought-provoking.  The Q&A with the co-director, [Michael Tucker][],
was very interesting too.  I’d thoroughly recommend seeing it.  In fact,
it’s due to be shown in a shortened form (an hour) on BBC Four, as part
of their Storyville season, in January.  Well worth a watch.

Here’s someone else’s [longer review][].
